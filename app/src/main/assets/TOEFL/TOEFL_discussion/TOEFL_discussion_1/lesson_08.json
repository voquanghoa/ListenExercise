That's common with sophomores. Um, have you narrowed down your possibilities? Do you have a list?\nS: Uh, no, I don't. I've...I've always had a hard time making decisions, especially hard ones.\nA: All right. Well, why don't we start with subjects that you're sure you don't want to major in.\nS: OK. Well, I hate science, and I'm not very good at math, so those are out. Um, I don't think business would be good for me. I don't want to wear a suit and work in an office from 9 to 5. Uh...I like to move around, you know, maybe get outside, and kind of be my own boss. I don't want someone looking over my shoulder all the time.\nA: Mmm...we're off to a good start. No business, math, or science. So, let's switch gears and consider topics you might want to choose for a major. Um...of all the subjects you've taken last year and so far this term, which ones have you liked? What kinds of classes have you found interest you the most?\nS: There's a lot them. I love literature, and my psychology class was also pretty interesting. Philosophy was kind of cool; so was world history with Professor Briggs. I learned a lot in my visual arts class, and...oh yeah, my roommate talked me into taking sociology, which I thought would be boring, but it turned out to be great! So, um, that's the problem. I like so many different things, I can't pick just one of them!\nA: Oh, I see. Hey, do you like to write by any chance?\nS: Yeah! English was one of my favorite classes in high school, and one of my best too! I got all A's, except for one B+ from Ms. Horowitz junior year.\nA: I've got an idea. How about trying journalism?\nS: Journalism?! You mean, like being a newspaper reporter or magazine writer?\nA: Yes. Journalists have to cover many different stories, so they learn a little about a lot of things. You wouldn't be chained to a desk all day, and you'd work largely on your own, gathering material and writing stories. There's something different to learn about almost every day. Also, many of the classes you've already taken satisfy the first-year requirements of the journalism department. You see, they want you to take a broad spectrum of classes. You don't even start taking classes in the journalism department until next year.\nS: Hmm...I've never thought of journalism before. Yeah, maybe I should check into it. But, um, what if I try it and it turns out that I don't really like it?\nA: Well, while you're trying it, you'll be learning about, uh, all sorts of topics. If you find one of those that you like better, you could change your major. You'd just need to go to the registrar's office and fill out some paperwork.\nS: Um, OK! I'll check out journalism, then. Thank you, Mr. Grouton.\nA: You're welcome. Remember, the adviser's office is open every weekday from 8 to 4, if there's anything else I can do for you."}
