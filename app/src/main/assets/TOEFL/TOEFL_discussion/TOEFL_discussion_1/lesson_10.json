You are in my, um, American History 201 class, right? How can I help you today?\nS: It's about my term paper. I, uh, I know it's due next Monday, but, um, I was hoping...I don't think I can get it done by then. Could I please turn it in by the end of next week instead? I have a really good excuse.\nP: Oh I'm sure you do! [chuckles]. I've been teaching 33 years. Do you know how many excuses I've heard? \"My dog ate my paper.\" \"My roommate had a party so I couldn't concentrate.\" \"I have seven papers due on the same day!\" \"I went home to see my parents and my car broke down.\" My favorite was a student who told me she \"forgot\" all about her term paper until the day before it was due. It's amazing she remembered to come to class.\nS: [Laughs nervously] I didn't forget, sir. I've been working on the paper, really! Here, I brought my outline and a rough draft. It's, um, just that...well, a lot of things have been going on in my life, and I'm having trouble managing things.\nP: I see. You know, I assigned that paper four weeks ago, and I've been reminding students about it in each class. So, tell me your story. What's happening in your life?\nS: First, about two weeks ago, my roommate found out his mother is real sick. She has breast cancer. So he's been really upset, and, uh, I went home with him for a couple of days to see his mom. That caused me to miss biology lab, and I have a huge biology final coming up on Tuesday that I really need to study for this weekend. Then I got the flu last week, and missed a day of class. I tried to work on your paper that day, but I really felt horrible...\nP: OK, I can understand that. I'm glad that you're, er, helping your roommate through a tough time. That's more important than school work. But all this seems to have happened recently. What about the two weeks after I first assigned the term paper?\nS: I, uh [sheepishly]...I guess I didn't use that time very well. I kind of put off getting started on it.\nP: [Sighs]. Yes, you did. You know, if I had a dollar for every time I've heard a student say that...\nS: I'm sorry, Professor Dalton. I've learned my lesson. If I had spent just a little bit of time each week on the paper, I could have had it done on time. I know now that I need to plan for unexpected things.\nP: You seem like a bright, conscientious young man, Mr...your first name's Jack, isn't it? When I was a young student, an upperclassman gave me some advice that I've never forgotten. He said, \"You're going to find yourself with a lot of small gaps during school days -- 15 minutes, or half and hour. What you do during those gaps will make a big difference in how successful you are.\"\nS: Wow! That's great advice.\nP: Yeah, I thought so. And I still do. So I'll tell you what. You can turn your paper in no later than 9 a.m. Friday, right here on my office desk. In exchange for this favor, I want you to pass that advice on to all your friends and dorm mates.\nS: Thank you, professor Dalton! You bet I will.\nP: Um, as long as you're here, let me take a peek at your outline and rough draft. Do you have any questions about the paper that I can help you with?"}
