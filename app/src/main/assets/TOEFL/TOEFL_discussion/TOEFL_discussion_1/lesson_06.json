Chemistry One Twenty-one, morning lectures. Are sections-- ?\nR1: Oh, sorry, you're at the wrong table. This is Upper Division sciences. University College courses are at Tables Four through Nine.\nT: Really? Damn.\nR1: Let's see. Chemistry? You want Table Five, Physical and Social Sciences.\nT: OK, thanks very much. (He goes.)\nR2: Next, please.\nT: Good morning. Have you got Bone-- uh-- Chemistry One Twenty-one here?\nR2: Yes. Could I see your student ID card, please?\nT: Here you are.\nR2: Thank you. Now... One Twenty-one...what sections would you like?\nT: Uh, Tuesday and Thursday, Sections One or Two?\nR2: There're spaces available in both of those. Section One starts at seven forty-five a.m. and Two is from nine to ten.\nT: Well, seven forty-five's a little early for me. It's the same lecturer for both sections, isn't it?\nR2: Sorry, you'll have to check that in your Course Guide.\nT: How many spaces are left in Section Two?\nR2: It's a little early for a lot of students. Section One still has about forty spaces left, but Two only has ten.\nT: Rats. I want to be in the same section as my roomie, but he doesn't register until ten today, and by then, those may be gone. All right, give me Section One, please.\nR2: There you are. And what about your lab section?\nT: I think any Friday section is OK for me.\nR2: Section Twenty-one is twelve to two o'clock, Section Twenty-two is one to three, Section Twenty-three is two thirty to four thirty, and Section Twenty-four is three thirty to five thirty.\nT: All right then, let me have the one-to-three o'clock one. Section Twenty-two?\nR: Yes, there you are.\nT: Thanks. And can I register for Ethology Two Sixty-three here, too?\nR2: Yes. But, um... there's only one section in that course: Monday-Wednesday-Friday from one o'clock to two. You've got a conflict with your chem lab.\nT: Oh, no! (sighs)\nR2: Do you want your laboratory on a different day?\nT: No. Uh, what were the times on those other lab sections again?\nR2: Twelve to two, one to three, two thirty to four thirty, and three thirty to five thirty.\nT: I'll take two thirty to four thirty, then. Could I change this card for that one? Sorry.\nR2: Sure, here you go. And here's your section card for Ethology.\nT: Thanks very much. Are there plenty of spaces left in Twenty-three?\nR2: They won't go in an hour. Your friend should have no trouble getting one. Is that it now?\nT: That'll do it, thanks.\nR2: OK. Please print your name and student number clearly in the blanks on each card.\nT: OK. \"Ter-ry...mm...eight four four four one...mmm....\" There you are.\nR2: And don't forget to write these into your class schedule: Chemisty One Twenty-one, Lecture Section One, Tuesday and Thursday, seven forty-five. Laboratory Section Twenty-three, Friday, two thirty. Ethology Two Sixty-three, Monday-Wednesday-Friday, one to two p.m.\nT: Thanks very much for your help!\nR2: Have a nice day. Next, please?"}
