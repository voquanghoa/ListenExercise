That's the last one!\nRachel: Hi, David. Sit down. The last what?\nD: My last exam. That's it for me for this term!\nR: Lucky guy! I've still got one exam left tomorrow.\nD: Which one?\nR: Microeconomics. And I'm dreading it.\nD: Yeah? How come? Couldn't be that hard for you. You're an Economics major, aren't you, Rachel?\nR: Yeah. It shouldn't be, I know, but somehow- I'm just not getting a handle on it. Too much math, I guess. I'm more of a theoretician. (laughs)\nD: (laughs) Yeah, you and John Maynard Keynes. Rachelian Economics- where supply and demand are not inversely related.\nR: (laughs) Anyway, I've just barely squeaked by all of her quizzes- and I only got sixty-nine percent on the midterm.\nD: Oy! You'd better burn some midnight oil tonight, then.\nR: Don't worry- I'm planning to. Want coffee?\nD: No thanks. I gotta run in a minute.\nR: How come? I thought you were all done.\nD: I am. I want to pick up the tickets for the Homecoming game.\nR: Haven't you done that yet? I thought you were all gung-ho for Homecoming. I hope there're still some left.\nD: No problem. They're already bought and paid for. I just have to pick them up at the frat house. Zeta Tau always buys a block of seats so we can 'command a presence'- and make fools of ourselves.\nR: (laughs) Well, that should be easy.\nD: (laughs) Yeah, our reputation's not so hot, is it? But this year's officers have been trying to untarnish our image. Get us off our slippery slope to utter degradation.\nR: (laughs) Good luck. Gotta date?\nD: Huh? Uh...erm...well...I just thought you, uh, would....\nR: Come with you? And get beer and catsup splattered all over me? And get both eardrums shattered? You gotta be kidding. You're on your own for this one, David.\nD: Aw, c'mon, Rachel. It'll be fun! I'll buy you a big chrysanthemum!\nR: Tempting, but...no. I've gotta get packed, anyway.\nD: Packed?\nR: I'm going home for the break- and I leave real early the next morning.\nD: Oh. OK. Well, I guess I'll just batch it, then. That means I can drink more and make a bigger idiot of myself without you there.\nR: Yeah, look at it that way. How'd you do on your finals, anyway?\nD: Oh, pretty good overall, I think. I'm not too sanguine about my chances of passing Biometrics, but the others have been fine. I should get an A in Genetics, and either As or Bs in Cell Biology and Animal Behavior. Biometrics- that's been awful. It's all statistics and probabilities and variances and things. All, um, higher math!\nR: Ha! Well, I empathize. That's my Achilles' heel, too. Numbers just don't like me.\nD: Or you just don't like numbers. Y'know, I actually liked arithmetic when I was little. It was so logical. And algebra, geometry- I enjoyed those. No grey areas, I guess.\nR: You probably liked playing with your compass and protractor, didn't you?\nD: Ha! Funny you should say that. I actually impaled myself on my compass one time- horsing around at school, and I ran it right through my finger! The school nurse had to pull it out for me. Gross!\nR: Ack! That gives me the shivers! I didn't know mathematics could be so dangerous.\nD: Yeah. Anyway, when I got to calculus in high school, the wheels suddenly came off. I hit a brick wall, just suddenly could not understand what in heck was going on. That's the point where math and me came to a parting of the ways.\nR: Sounds like my story- except for the puncture wound! I guess we should just keep sharp objects out of your hands, eh?\nD: Yeah, that would be safest. How about your finals?\nR: Oh. Yeah, they'll be all right. Micro tomorrow is my only real worry. World Economies is good- I should ace that. And maybe ace Political Systems, too- I think Dr West likes me.\nD: Huh?! What do you mean, \"likes\" you?\nR: No, no- I just mean that he thinks I'm an eager student, so he'll give me the, the benefit of the doubt, maybe, on my final grade. If there is any. I wrote him a real nice mid-term essay.\nD: That thing on \"the joys of capitalism\"?\nR: Right.\nD: Didn't you just copy that out of Wikipedia?\nR: Hey, hey!- I did research, yes!- and I cited every single source, thank you!\nD: Sure you did. Oh! Gotta go. I told them I'd be stopping by at three.\nR: OK.\nD: Sure you don't want to come?\nR: I'll pass.\nD: OK then. ...I wonder... that nice blonde in my Behavior class....\nR: Watch your mouth, buster!\nD: (laughs) OK, OK. Next time, then.\nR: Maybe. Bye.\nD: Bye."}
