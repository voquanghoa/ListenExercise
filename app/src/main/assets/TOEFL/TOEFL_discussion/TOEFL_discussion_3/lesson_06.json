I've gotta find work by July or August at the latest. I'm going to have no money left at all after this term. You going?\nW: Yep. I don't really need to find a job right away- I can always part-time in my dad's shop- but I do have to get going on my career, eh? Or I'll end up in his workshop maybe forever.\nZ: What kind of business is it, anyway?\nW: Woodworking. He makes mostly commercial stuff- store counters, shelving, barber stations, things like that, you know.\nZ: He does a good business?\nW: Yes, actually. It's been growing recently, too. He's got three journeyman carpenters with him now. Business has been good.\nZ: You're not interested, though?\nW: Geez...not really, no. The work's pretty boring. It's really repetitive, the same models from his catalogue over and over. I want to find something more, uh...creative, y'know.\nZ: Like what?\nW: Oh, like something in, uh, interior design- or maybe in an architect's office or somewhere... I dunno.\nZ: Well, there oughtta be some companies like that at the fair. I know there're a couple of big construction firms coming.\nW: Hmm. Yeah, they might have something interesting....\nZ: Still- it seems a shame, though, not to take over your father's business. Maybe you could, you know, think about expanding it, for instance. In the direction you want to go- maybe offer, um, design services? Uh, custom services?\nW: Hmm. I probably could do that. Yeah. That might be an idea at that....\nZ: You could at least, you know, try it out, maybe this summer. If you don't find another job.\nW: Lemme think about that. Actually, uh...erm....\nZ: What?\nW: Actually, I'll tell you a, another reason I don't really want to work in my dad's place. It's a carpentry shop, right? With a lot of table saws and radial arm saws and band saws, you know? And, well, every carpenter there- Dad included- has a missing finger or two. Or three.\nZ: Huh?!\nW: Yeah. The work's repetitive, like I said, eh? And if it's your job eight hours a day to run boards through a saw, and inevitably, sometimes, you lose your, uh, concentration- someone tells a joke or something, y'know- and, well...ZIP! goes your thumb through the saw with the board. Dad's missing the last two fingers of his left hand- just whacked 'em off in an instant when the phone rang once. They all try to be careful, of course, but, well, it's just, just an...occupational hazard. I work there long enough and I'm gonna lose an appendage too.\nZ: Oh wow! That's awful! I guess I wouldn't want to work there either. Ack! I can't blame you for wanting out. What's your dad think of that decision, though?\nW: Oh, I dunno what he really thinks, but he's very supportive. He says I should follow by own path, wherever it leads. But I don't think he's really, y'know, attached to the business- it's just what he got into and what he knows how to do, and what he makes money at.\nZ: Is he going to retire?\nW: Oh, yeah! He's looking forward to it, too. Then he can get down to this first love....\nZ: Which is...?\nW: Toy soldiers. He makes them. He's got a whole army in our basement- Bengal Lancers, Soaves, Beefeaters, hussars, you name it!- he casts 'em in lead, paints 'em, puts 'em in little, uh, dioramas, you know what I mean? He's good at it, too.\nZ: Wow, what a gas!\nW: Yeah. So there's no love lost between him and the workshop. He'll be glad to be done with it, I think.\nZ: OK- so you're coming to the job expo then, to find a career? When are you going?\nW: Early, I guess. When does it open?\nZ: Nine-thirty.\nW: That's Saturday, right?\nZ: Right. I don't suppose you've made an appointment?\nW: Huh? No. Do we have to?\nZ: No, but it's a good idea if you know who you want to see. It's gonna be crowded at some of the booths- the ones for the prestige companies- and it makes a good impression if you've got one. Shows you're professional. Shows you're serious.\nW: So you've got one?\nZ: Yeah, I've got appointments at ten and eleven with two engineering firms, ATC and Industrial Services.\nW: Well. Hmm. I have no idea who to get an appointment with. I'll just have to look around when I get there, I guess.\nZ: Good planning, Walter. It's easy to see who's hungry for work here. Why don't you check the list of participants in the Counselling Office? You've still got time to make an appointment with one of them.\nW: Ah! Yeah, OK- I'll do that. I'll go over there right now. Your enthusiasm's contagious, Zelda. Thanks.\nZ: OK- and I'll see you at the fair somewhere, I guess.\nW: No, you'll see me before that- we've got Drafting class together tomorrow afternoon, remember? See you.\nZ: Oh, yeah. See you. Good luck."}
