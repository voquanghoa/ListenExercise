Thanks.\nA: Here you are. Ladies first.\nB: Ah. Mmm. Lessee...what've they got for salads? Caesar...spinach...garden....\nA: What's the difference? They're all mostly lettuce anyway.\nB: Maybe, but I like... croutons.. Caesar's for me.... Oh, hand me some, uh, oil-and-vinegar, will you?\nA: Here. Hmm... And the lettuce looks wilted. Fruit for me, I guess.\nB: Grapes? I thought you didn't like them.\nA: I don't like the green ones, that's all.\nB: Oh.\nA: And lessee.... Today's entrees are- Salisbury steak...buffalo wings...filet of sole...and uh, veal cutlets. Hmm. I guess I'll have fish again.\nB: Why? Low cholesterol?\nA: No, it just looks better than the rest. Like it might be edible.\nB: (Laughs) I see. (To the server) Give me the veal please, with, uh, mashed potatoes and, um, string beans, I guess.\nA: Did you finish your homework?\nB: For Art History? Sort of. I've got my talk down, I think. But I've still got to make copies of one of his paintings for the class. I thought I'd do that right after lunch- it won't take a minute.\nA: Who've you got again?\nB: Turner. I found a really great print of his- \"Landscape with Walton Bridges\" it's called. (To the server) Oh, thank you.\nA: (To the server) And I'll have the sole. And fries, and, uh, succotash. (To Betty) Are you going to make color copies? They're not cheap.\nB: Yeah, but they're worth it. \"Walton Bridges\" is really fantastic. I'll show you when we sit down.\nA: OK. (To the server) Oh. Thanks.\nB: Lessee...silverware....\nA: Yeah...mm...napkin? Here.\nB: Oh, thanks, yeah. And, um... iced tea for me.\nA: Mm...and me, too. Hmm. All right. OK, let's find a table!\nB: Um. Oh- how about over there, by the window?\nA: Yes, that's good. I need some table room.\nB: What for?\nA: Uh, well... I've still got some organizing to do. Same class.\nB: Ah. (They sit down to eat) Who are you talking on?\nA: Dali. Chow down!\nB: Eh?\nA: Salvador Dali. You know, the surrealist. The guy with the moustache.\nB: (laughs) Oh, yeah! The guy with the moustache. Do you think he was crazy?\nA: Crazy like a fox, maybe. He made a lot of money later on his career, cranking out trash for the most part. He put on a real, um, show, though, didn't he?\nB: (laughs) Sure did.\nA: But I really admire his imagination- some really wild stuff, those melted clocks and hollow beasts. Very evocative images. And actually, he did a lot of research. Do you know the story about his Corpus Hypercubus?\nB: His what?\nA: It's a cubist painting of the Crucifixion- you know, of Christ on the Cross.\nB: No, what's the story?\nA: Well, you'll have to wait for class- I'm still working on it.\nB: Aw, c'mon!\nA: No, I can't, really. It's about the mathematics he used, but I've gotta tell it right. And I gotta get that together right after lunch! Can I see your Turner print, though?\nB: Oh. Yes, sure. I've got it right, um...here.\nA: Wow.\nB: Isn't that great? Look at that light!\nA: It's so Italianate- the pastoral atmosphere is so thick you could cut it with a knife! Turner's so modern, isn't he? All colour and mood, and almost no form, except for these wispy trees here. Truly amazing! There's every imaginable shade of gold in there, isn't there?\nB: Can you believe this was painted before the middle of the 19th century?\nA: Really, eh? Are you going to eat the rest of that salad?\nB: No, you can have it. Here. Are you going to stay here and finish your presentation?\nA: Yeah. We've still got over an hour before class.\nB: OK, then. I'm going to just run over to the Campus Shop and get this xeroxed and then come back. How many do I need? Ten?\nA: Plus one for Dr Auburn- that's eleven. But if they're too expensive, I don't need one. I've seen it already.\nB: (laughs) It's not going to break me. You get one too. See you.\nA: Yeah, OK. See you here in a few minutes then."}
