Building Q22.\nU: Q...?\nF: It's supposed to be behind the Flagler Arts Hall here, but there's nothing there but trees that I can see.\nU: Can't see the forest for the trees, huh? Where'd you get that map?\nF: Oh, it's from our orientation guide. I didn't want to carry the whole thing around with me, so I just tore out the map. (chuckles)\nU: Huh. Good idea. Can I see?\nF: Sure. Here. See- we're here, Circle Road, right? And here's the Arts Hall, right here, number eighteen....\nU: Yeah...mmm....\nF: And then Q22 is right- here. Behind it.\nU: Yes, but...which way are we facing? Look- Circle Road curves around the Arts Hall, and we're...uh...we're here, on the left side of the building, see?\nF: Huh? Oh...then...Q22 must be...around to the...right of the Hall from here.\nU: C'mon, let's check. I'll go with you.\nF: Thanks, but you don't have to....\nU: Naw, that's OK. I'm curious.\nF: Thanks, then.\nU: (supposing) You're a freshman, aren't you?\nF: How'd you guess? (laughs)\nU: (laughs) 'Cause I was one myself a couple of years ago. I couldn't find my physics laboratory till the second week.\nF: Really? (laughs)\nU: Yeah, and it was in a Quonset, too.\nF: A what?\nU: A Quonset- a Quonset hut- that's what the 'Q' stands for. It's an old US Army hut.\nF: An Army hut? Was this a military base before?\nU: No. (laughs) After the Second World War, all the GIs came home, and a lot of them went back to college on the GI Bill.\nF: What's that?\nU: The GI Bill? Oh, the government offered returning soldiers almost a...an almost free education. And the state universities were flooded with students. They were...they suddenly needed a lot of extra classrooms and dormitory space. And the federal government responded by giving them a lot of, well, temporary structures that were no longer needed by the military. Perfect recycling, eh? And there's one now! Q22!\nF: Wow! That's a funny-looking thing. It looks like the top half of a big sewer pipe or something.\nU: Yep, not very elegant, I'm afraid- but very practical. And cold in the winter; the thing's poorly insulated. But they were a good quick fix to the problem of growing enrollment.\nF: Jeez- they set these up in the fifties, and we're still using them in 2009? These things are more than fifty years old. And they're temporary?\nU: Yeah. (laughs) But as long as they keep saving money for the university.... Oh, there's not near as many Quonsets as there used to be. SFU expanded a lot in the 1970s with the baby boomers, so they built a lot of new buildings then and got rid of a lot of the Quonsets. But there's still a few around, stuck in the bushes.\nF: Like my music class here. Look at this thing: it's made of corrugated iron! The acoustics actually might be pretty good, though, with this arched roof.\nU: What kind of music class?\nF: Oh, it's part of my practicum. They put us right into the SFU student orchestra, and that practices here once a week.\nU: A good thing they stuck you out in the woods here, then. You won't be bothering anyone with the noise.\nF: Noise? We make byoo-ti-ful music!\nU: What do you play?\nF: French horn.\nU: One of those, uh, curled things?\nF: Yeah.\nU: Well.... Anyplace else you've gotta find?\nF: Nope. I'm ready for my first class now, I think. Sure is a big campus, though.\nU: Yeah. We're a land grant college. The federal government gave it all this land in the beginning. And there's still a lot left that they haven't developed yet. The agriculture school uses it for pasture.\nF: Pasture?\nU: Sure- they've got livestock- cattle, horses, you know. SFU operates a farm right on campus. That's where the student cafeteria gets its fresh eggs every day. And some of its hamburger.\nF: You're kidding.\nU: Not at all. You'll see. Take a walk out to the south end of campus some Sunday. It's like a stroll in the country. It's great!- very relaxing after a tough exam.\nF: Huh. OK, I will. Thanks. And thanks for your help finding the, the...what?\nU: Quonset hut.\nF: Oh yeah, 'quonset hut'.\nU: No problem. See you around.\nF: Deal."}
