What are you doing here so early?\nCecille: Hi, Robert. Oh, I got tired of sitting in the cafeteria, that's all. I have an hour break before this class, and I usually, uh, spend it there... but it's so noisy today! Why are you here early?\nR: Oh, I always come in about now- it's a quiet place to go over my notes before class.\nC: Gee, aren't you the eager beaver!\nR: I just find it's a, a good way to review and at the same time try to keep up with, uh, with where this course is going. Cost Accounting is pretty difficult for me. Why's the cafeteria so noisy? There shouldn't be many people there at three in the afternoon. Lunch is done.\nC: There's a sort of rally going on- for the demonstration.\nR: Demonstration?\nC: Yeah, Friday.\nR: Really? Against what? What's it about?\nC: Tuition. It's about the tuition increase.\nR: Oh, yeah, the tuition increase. They're holding a demonstration?\nC: You don't get around campus much, do you? They've got posters plastered up all over the place.\nR: No, I guess I don't. I just come in for this class and for, um, Financial Management Thursday nights. I didn't think this fee rise was such a big thing, though. It seems to happen couple of years or so, regular as clockwork.\nC: Well, I guess this one was just the last straw.\nR: Why's that?\nC: Because the economy's so bad. Students don't have any money. Their parents don't have any money. They just can't afford to pay any more for school right now.\nR: I suppose that's so. I manage, but I haven't had a raise in more than four years myself.\nC: You're working?\nR: Yeah. That's why I'm taking only two classes. I'm a bookkeeper.\nC: A bookkeeper? Where at?\nR: Lightsey Furniture, downtown. I've been working there part-time since before I started Accounting School, three days a week. That's- It's enough to pay my expenses, even the tuition boost- if I'm careful with my money.\nC: You don't have such big fees to pay, though, if you're just taking those two classes. With a full load, most of us are having to fork out close to five hundred dollars more a term!\nR: Ouch! I'd protest at that too, I guess. Are you going?\nC: To the demonstration? I dunno. I've been thinking about it, but, well, I'm not really one to, uh, climb on the bandwagon.\nR: It's turning into that, is it?\nC: Seems to be- there's a lot of people over at the cafeteria, anyway, and they seem pretty enthusiastic about this thing.\nR: Don't you think this might be just a \"college thing\", though? Students getting riled up just for the sake of getting riled up? We're so righteous, so sensitive to injustices. UBC must have a good reason for raising its tuition, I'm sure- it's a non-profit institution, for heaven's sake!\nC: Oh, no doubt, no doubt. Student idealism? Some of that too, I guess, but-\nR: But- it's hard times. I get it. And how's your economy?\nC: Oh, I'm OK. My money comes from Daddy's education trust.\nR: Trust? You must be rich!\nC: (laughs) I wish. No, this isn't a trust like a Rockefeller trust! This is a fancy savings account Daddy started when I was born. He put a little money into it every month, and over- what?- eighteen years, that grew to enough to get me through university. And God bless Daddy!\nR: Amen! Good for you!\nC: Yeah, I'm lucky- and I've got enough to finish out my last year now, no problem. But a lot of others, they're not so lucky. Some of 'em aren't going to be able to finish school- they just don't have another five hundred or a thousand dollars in their budget.\nR: What time is that protest Friday?\nC: I think it starts at four, why? Thinking of going?\nR: (sighs) Yeah, I am, actually. I'd like to get a few more details first, though. Do you know where-\nC: There's some flyers in the cafeteria and over at the Student Union, and at some other places on campus, I guess. You could pick one of those up.\nR: Yes, I think I will. After class.\nC: Tell you what- I'll go with you. And if you decide to participate Friday, I'll meet you there.\nR: Or we could meet somewhere else first.\nC: And make placards and headbands? (laughs)\nR: (Laughs) Maybe. Anyway, it would be easier than trying to find you in the crowd. And we could plan our escape if it gets too rough.\nC: Gee, do you think it could?\nR: Oh, probably not. But it's better to be safe than sorry.\nC: Yeah, I suppose so. Oh- here comes Dr Smithers.\nR: Rats! And I never reviewed my notes. Talk to you after class."}
