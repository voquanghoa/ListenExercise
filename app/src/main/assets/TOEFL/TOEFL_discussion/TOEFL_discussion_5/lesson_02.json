Oh. Oh hi, Wendy. How are you today?\nW: Good, thanks. Uh...what, what're you doing in class so early? Can I...?\nA: I'm...I need to use Power Point this morning, but-- for my presentation, y'know?-- but I can't...I can't...it won't boot, and...\nW: Can I help you somehow?\nA: Uh, no, I don't think so, thanks. Or...darn! Well, I've checked all the cabling here twice. See? -- it's plugged into the USB port all right...here and-- at the projector, here...\nW: Yeah. Yeah, they seem OK to me too. And the AC?\nA: Oh. Yes, it's fine.\nW: Yes, it's in there OK. And...you turned on the computer, didn't you?\nA: Huh? Yes. No... well, sure, but-- I just leave the power switch on all the time. Actually, I don't even remember...\nW: ...where it is? Heh! It should be here, on the side...about here... Uh, no. What is this, anyway? A Sony, eh? Hmm. Maybe...yeah, here it is, over here. They always hide them, don't they?\nA: I didn't know where it was. I never use it.\nW: There, it's on... No, I think I've turned it off now. There-- it's on now. It should be.\nA: All right, good...um... No, nothing.\nW: It takes a minute to boot up, Anouk. At least mine does. Windows Seven?\nA: No, XP. I hear Seven is not so good.\nW: Really? I think you're thinking of Vista. I've got Seven and I like it a lot. So far, anyway. I got it for Christmas.\nA: Yeah? Well, anyway, I'm sticking with Windows XP for now. I'm comfortable with it, and I've got no complaints... But I don't see it yet.\nW: Nothing, eh?\nA: Nope, nothing.\nW: Uh. OK, then...what else? It was working OK in your room, wasn't it?\nA: Oh yes, sure. I practiced my presentation last night, and it was running just fine. Where's that power switch again? Here?... Um. Yeah, it's on, all right. Now what?\nW: And the power goes to...um...where? Oh, the outlet here on the lectern. And...\nA: Yeah, this's just how the professor sets his up. I don't get it.\nW: But-- is this outlet on? I mean-- where does it plug in, anyway?\nA: Huh? I never-- ah! Down here. And-- that's it! The lectern's not plugged in! Into this floor socket, see? Damn...There, now how's that?\nW: Let's see. Hang on now...There! There she is!\nA: Hey! There she is indeed! Great! Thanks, Wendy, thanks a lot. Electricity-- phooey! When are they going to make electricity wireless, anyway?\nW: Can they do that?\nA: Do what?\nW: Make it wireless. Give us electricity with no wires, no plugs, no extension cords.\nA: Well, I think so, yes. We can transfer electrical power by induction, can't we?\nW: I dunno. What's that? What's 'induction'?\nA: Didn't you take any physics? How'd you get into this course, anyway? You remember-- magnetic fields. You remember the experiment where you use the magnet and a bunch of iron filings? The filings show the nice symmetric magnetic field around the magnet's poles?\nW: Oh. Yeah. All the electrons are pointing in one direction or something, right? Just like electricity.\nA: It IS electricity, actually. That's what electricity is-- a line of flowing electrons.\nW: But they don't really flow anywhere, do they?\nA: Well, no. They don't. Each electron just kind of bumps the next electron, sort of. Anyway...\nW: Anyway, so...if they could make that happen efficiently, I mean, without much energy loss and, and... across long distances, then-- they could make electricity wireless, I guess.\nA: Right!...Theoretically.\nW: So-- we wouldn't need batteries anymore, for one thing. No more dead batteries. No more pollution from discarded batteries-- that'd be good.\nA: Yeah-- except when you're out in the woods or somewhere. Your camping equipment, your flashlight and-- you know-- you'd be too far from an electricity source, even a wireless source. You'd need batteries.\nW: Yeah, I guess. But not if we were in the city, say.\nA: No.\nW: And we wouldn't need a cord that we might forget to plug in.\nA: Oh, very funny.\nW: So are you all set up now? Your presentation is first, isn't it? What's it about again?\nA: Um...I call it \"Research Planning: Catching all the Details before you Start\". Guess I should pay better attention to my own presentation, shouldn't I?\nW: (laughs) Maybe. Good luck with it, Anouk. I'll be rooting for you.\nA: Thanks!"}
