Can I help you?\nStudent: Yeah. Hi. I'm, I'm not feeling very good. I think I might've caught the flu or something.\nHW: Oh, OK. I think the doctor can see you in just a few minutes.\nS: Thank you.\nHW: And could you just sit down here and fill out this form, please? Just fill out this section, here, and down here, where the stars are.\nS: Yes, OK. Have you got a pen?\nHW: Oh, yes. Sorry. Here you are.\nS (she writes on the form): OK...umm...and...oh. I don't have my student card with me. I can't remember my student number... seven...seven three...um.\nHW: Oh. Well...uh, have you been here before?\nS: Um, yes. Yes, I have, actually. Last summer. I had poison ivy. (laughs) In June.\nHW: Poison ivy? Oh dear! In June...You should have a file here already. Your name is...?\nS: Stephens. Shirley Stephens.\nHW: OK, just a minute, Shirley. I'll see if I can find your file. That's 'Stevens' with a 'V'?\nS: No, with a 'PH'. S-T-E-P-H-E-N-S.\nHW: OK. Um...'R'...'S'...'Stafford'...'Stephens'. Here it is. Let's see...Poison ivy rash...You were here on June 17th, and you saw Dr. Hemmings. And your student number is...7364-UC 12.\nS: ...Mmm...U - C - 12. And um...this is May 20th?\nHW: Yes, the 20th.\nS (writing): OK. Um... OK. There you are. I guess I've...\nHW: Yes, OK. That's good. Now, uh...in the last six months have you-- been hospitalized for any illness?\nS: No.\nHW: Have you visited any foreign countries or received any immunizations?\nS: No. Oh, yes. I drove to Vancouver for a couple of days last Easter. Does that count? No immunizations, though.\nHW: No, that's OK. Are you currently taking any medications?\nS: No. Are vitamins medications? And glucosamine? I take those every day.\nHW: Glucosamine? Why are you taking that?\nS: Oh, the trainer suggested it to me.\nHW: Trainer?\nS: Uh-huh. At the gym. I go to the campus sports centre three times a week\nHW: Oh. Good for you. But-- ?\nS: But-- so, maybe I've been training too hard. My ankles and wrists kind of...ached. So the trainer suggested I try glucosamine. She said it was mild, that it was harmless, but it might help a bit.\nHW: Ah.\nS: Was she wrong?\nHW: Oh, probably not. Many athletes and older people take it. But I think we'd better write it down. We'll let the doctor decide.\nS: It's not prescription.\nHW: I know, but we'll let the doctor decide. Better to be safe than sorry, don't you think?\nS: Yes. I suppose so.\nHW: And, uh...Have you ever had or been treated for rheumatic fever?\nS: No.\nHW: Heart trouble?\nS: No.\nHW: Hepatitis A or B?\nS: No.\nHW: HIV / AIDS?\nS: No.\nHW: And do you smoke?\nS: No.\nHW: Do you drink alcohol?\nS: Yes, a little.\nHW: More than six ounces a day?\nS: No, not that much.\nHW: OK. And uh...What are your symptoms today?\nS: Well. My stomach feels awful. Like I'm going to throw up, you know. And I, I think I've got a fever. Anyway, I feel hot. I was really sweating when I woke up this morning. And, umm... I guess that's it, really.\nHW: Any diarrhea or constipation?\nS: No, no. I had a...\nHW: ... a bowel movement?\nS: Yes. This morning.\nHW: And your menstrual cycle?\nS: Oh, my period won't start for about two weeks yet.\nHW: All right. I guess that's it for right now. If you'll wait over there, the doctor will see you in just a moment or two.\nS: Uh...um... Could I drink anything? Is it OK if I get myself an orange juice or something?\nHW: Sure, if you feel like it.\nS: Uh, I don't really, no. But I thought I'd just try it to settle my stomach. I dunno.\nHW (chuckles): Well, if the juice doesn't work, the restrooms are right over there.\nS: Oh dear... now I don't...\nHW: And the vending machines are in the corridor.\nS (feeling like she is going to vomit): Uh...ugh!... no. Oh! I shouldn't've thought about it... Now I think-- I have to-- Oh! Oh!--\nHW: Be careful! DON'T RUN!"}
