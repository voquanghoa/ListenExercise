I'm, uh, I'm taking a student survey as a part of my Sociology course, and, um, I wonder if I could ask you a few questions?\nJ: Uh... well- how long will it take?\nS: Oh, only about three minutes. Do you have time?\nJ: Hmm. Yes, I guess so. Only three minutes, eh?\nS: Yes, and it's anonymous. I only need to ask your age, sex, and, um, university year.\nJ: OK. Sure. Go ahead.\nS: Thanks. (recites) This is a student survey in partial fulfillment of the requirements for Sociology 117. No identifying information will be collected. This survey constitutes research data for the topic \"The Relation of Student Alcohol Consumption to Student Attendance and Grade Point Average\". It will take approximately three minutes to complete. My name is Nancy Puzzio. Question one: What is your age?\nJ: I'm, uh, nineteen.\nS: And you're male.\nJ: Last time I looked, yes.\nS: And your year at BSU?\nJ: Third year. I graduate at the end of next academic year.\nS: Thank you. Now, the legal drinking age in this state is eighteen. Do you drink alcohol at all?\nJ: Uh, yes, I do. Sometimes.\nS: And have you been drinking alcohol since you turned eighteen, the legal drinking age?\nJ: Yes- I started on my eighteenth birthday, as a matter of fact.\nS: How often do you consume alcoholic beverages?\nJ: Oh, um...it's hard to say....\nS: Do you consume some quantity every day?\nJ: Huh? Oh, no. No- maybe once or twice a week, average.\nS: And what is your beverage of choice?\nJ: Oh, I drink beer usually. Occasionally wine. I don't like, uh, um, hard liquor.\nS: How many pints of beer do you consume in one drinking session?\nJ: \"Drinking session\"? I don't get sloshed every time I drink!\nS: No, \"session\" just means \"occasion\" or \"instance\"- it's a research term.\nJ: Oh, I see. Uh... two, three pints maybe.\nS: Once or twice a week?\nJ: Yes, that's right.\nS: And would that be on regular days- weekends, for example?\nJ: Yes, that's right. Friday night, or Saturday night. Sometimes both.\nS: And for which of the following reasons would you say you primarily drink alcohol? A - stress. B - pleasure. C - socialization. D - habit?\nJ: Can I choose more than one?\nS: Yes.\nJ: Then, I guess I'd say for pleasure, mostly, and to relieve, um, stress? Stress. For relaxation, really- after a week of classes and studying, it's relaxing.\nS: Do you usually drink alone, or with others?\nJ: Oh. Sometimes alone. Usually with others- my roommate or classmates or somebody.\nS: And- do you ever consume sufficient alcohol to feel its aftereffects the following day?\nJ: You mean, do I ever have a hangover? No... Well, very rarely. Sometimes after a party.\nS: How often would you say you attend parties where alcoholic beverages are served?\nJ: Hmm. Maybe once in two or three months. Not often. Sometimes I get invited to a, a fraternity party or something, but not very often.\nS: Has the consumption of alcohol ever affected your class attendance or your ability to study?\nJ: No.\nS: Has the consumption of alcohol ever restricted your study or preparation time?\nJ: No, not really. Of course, I suppose I could be studying all Friday and Saturday nights, too. So in that, uh, sense, yes, I guess it does limit my studies in that way. But, uh, I think it's more important for good study habits to have that, er, relaxation time available, you know?\nS: OK. Have your drinking habits or quantities changed significantly since you began drinking?\nJ: No, I don't think so. No.\nS: And have your study habits or class attendance changed significantly during your time at BSU?\nJ: No, not really. I may be preparing a little more now. My courses are harder, and I'm more, well, concerned about grades now.\nS: What is your current GPA?\nJ: Three point eight.\nS: Oh! That's great! Well, thank you for your time. This is the end of the survey. If you're interested in the outcome of my research, I'll be, um, making it available to survey participants at the end of the semester. Here. This is my email address. Please email me if you'd like to get a copy of my survey results.\nJ: Yeah, I would, actually. This is kind of an interesting topic.\nS: Thank you for participating. Have a nice day.\nJ: You, too. And good luck on your paper.\nS: Thanks! 'Bye."}
