This isn't working.\nPeter: What isn't?\nM: This reaction. I'm supposed to get hydrogen gas, but I don't seem to be getting anything except air.\nP: How are you supposed to tell?\nM: Well, hydrogen gas should explode when I hold this burning splint up to the test tube- but... nothing happens, see?\nP: Hmm. Very unimpressive. How do you do this experiment, again?\nM: Well, I put some hydrochloric acid into this test tube here. And then I add a piece of zinc metal to it. A reaction takes place and hydrogen gas is produced- it says- which should come out of the glass tubing, over here, and go into this other test tube. But it doesn't.\nP: Nothing happens?\nM: Well, something happens. The zinc bubbles and bounces around- the acid does something to it. Some gas must be coming off, I guess, but it isn't flammable. It doesn't burn at all.\nP: Is there any way else to identify hydrogen?\nM: Not that I 've learned. It's completely colorless and tasteless, I know- it just burns very dramatically.\nP: Huh. Well, I dunno. Shall we run through your experiment again together and see how it goes?\nM: Sure, if you don't mind- that would be great! I'm sure I'm doing everything right, I've gone through it twice now, but I still get nothing, nada.\nP: OK. Lessee.... We need what? Clean test tubes? Two of 'em? Here we are. And... a rubber stopper with ten centimeters or so of glass tubing through it... right...uh...here. That's it?\nM: Yep. And a graduated cylinder and the Bunsen burner. And the zinc and the acid.\nP: All right: let's do this first- let's take the zinc and the HCl from different sources- from, uh, those reagent bottles on that lab table over there. Maybe your bottles are contaminated or mislabeled or something.\nM: Oh, good idea. Trust me to use the wrong reagents.\nP: Just a sec.... here we are... OK, now you run the experiment like you think you should, and I'll watch what you do.\nM: Well, first I clamp this test tube onto its stand...like this... and put in about five milliliters of the hydrochloric acid....\nP: \"About\" five milliliters?! Isn't this a scientific laboratory?\nM: All right, all right. Exactly five milliliters of HCl...like this....\nP: OK. Mmm... and....\nM: Then I take a little piece of zinc metal with these tweezers, like this, and-\nP: Are they all the same size?\nM: Yeah, they seem to be. It looks like they're pressed out of some kind of machine in standard bits.\nP: And add \"one\"?\nM: Yeah, one. Like this. And see?- it starts to bubble!\nP: Sure does!\nM: So I slap the stopper into the top of the test tube real quick, like- unh!- this....\nP: Mmm....\nM: And then, I hold the other test tube under the other end of the glass tubing, here...like this, and...uh, wait until I think I've collected enough hydrogen gas to ignite, I guess. Is the Bunsen burner going?\nP: Yes, it's burning- and you also need a splint, right? Here's one. Hey! Just a minute- how in heck are you going to collect any gas like that?!\nM: Like what?\nP: Like that- holding the test tube under the mouth of the tubing\nM: What? Am I spilling it or something?\nP: No, no- you're losing it entirely! Hydrogen is lighter than air, Marie. It's floating UP.\nM: Huh?\nP: It's floating up. It's rising from the tube mouth. It's not falling into your container. Hold it above the tube!\nM: Ack! How stupid! I am so stupid. I'm never gonna pass this course. OK, OK- now...light that for me, will you?\nP: Right...here you go.\nM: And.... POW! Wow, did you see that?\nP: And we've got lift off! And you've got hydrogen. Congratulations.\nM: Yeah. (sighs) Thanks, Peter. Now all I gotta do is write this experiment up.\nP: No problem. So, what's your next experiment?\nM: Uh, something about sodium and water.\nP: Oh no!"}
