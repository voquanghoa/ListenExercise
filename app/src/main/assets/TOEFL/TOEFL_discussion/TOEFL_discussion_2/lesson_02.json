Are you looking for something in particular?\nStudent: Yes, well... first I'm looking for the foreign language section.\nC: Oh, it's right down here. Here we are. \"Foreign Languages\". What course are you taking?\nS: Spanish Four Thirty-one.\nC: You need the Intermediate Spanish textbook?\nS: No, I still have that from Four Thirty. What I'm looking for is the novel we're supposed to read: Garcia Marquez's 'Cien aï¿½os de soledad'-- 'One Hundred Years of Solitude'.\nC: 'Garcia Marquez', 'Garcia Marquez'. Hmm. No... Oh, here it is, under 'Marquez'. Here you are.\nS: Eighteen dollars? The price is right, but, erm, it's just the text. There don't seem to be any footnotes or any glossary.\nC: Ah.\nS: This is the only edition you have?\nC: Yes, it is. Sorry.\nS: Hmm. How many copies do you have left? Just those on the shelf?\nC: Yes, uh, four-- no, five copies.\nS: Jeez, those'll be gone by Friday for sure. Our class is really full. What's your return policy? Would it be OK if I bought this now, and then returned it if I can find an annotated edition on the internet?\nC: Yes, certainly. But you'll need to keep your receipt, of course, and be sure that the book is not marked up or damaged in any way.\nS: Sure, that's fair enough.\nC: Did you want me to check whether we can find you another edition?\nS: I don't think I have time. It usually takes so long to get a book through a bookstore.\nC: (laughs) Unfortunately, that's often true.\nS: Thanks anyway. I'll take this then, and say-- you have, uh, sweatshirts, don't you?\nC: Sweatshirts? Yes, in the 'School Spirit' section. Over this way. And down here. Um. Here you are.\nS: Ah. Yes. Hmm....that's not much of a school crest.\nC: Oh. (laughs) There's a bigger one on the back, see?\nS: Oh, yeah, of course. I see. Uh, this is a medium. I need a large, and uh...I think...in green.\nC: Medium, medium...here, is this a large? Yes, large. Here you go.\nS: Yeah, that's good. Say, do you know what our motto means, anyway? \"Ex Pertinacia Veritas\". \"Out of something....something-or-other.\"\nC: \"From Determination comes Truth\". It's been SU's motto since it was founded in 1894. And this crest is \"an American bison couchant upon a tome vert\".\nS: What in heck does that mean?\nC: A buffalo lying on a green book. I think the idea was that this new pioneer state was getting its first institution of higher education-- the buffalo represents the prairies-- the green of the book-- and the book represents learning.\nS: Huh. That's really interesting. I'll wear it with pride-- and hope for some of that determination! How much is this?\nC: $39.95 plus tax.\nS: Fine. Uh, what else do I need now? Mmm.... I guess that's it, then: the sweatshirt and the book.\nC: And there's no tax on the book.\nS: Where's your register?\nC: Just take them up to the cashier at the front, please. Over there.\nS: Oh, OK. Thanks a lot for your help.\nC: Thank you. Have a nice day."}
