I think I left a book in this carrel last night. Could you just take a look in the shelf for me?\nL: Sure. What's the title?\nJ: Uh...\"Fundamentals of Bioengineering\" or something like that- I forget the exact title. (laughs) That's why I need it! It's a sort of green paperback.\nL: Huh. Looks like a couple of other folks've left their books in here, too. Why don't they put them back where they got them when they're through, anyway?\nJ: Probably just forgot, like me. It's easy to forget a book in there after you've been sitting here going through books for three or four hours at night.\nL: Yeah, I guess. I've done that, too. (laughs) How about, um, \"Engineering Basics\"? Is this it? It's not green, though. It's kind of, uh, turquoise?\nJ: Huh! That's kind of eerie, isn't it? That's really pretty close. No, not mine. Nothing else there?\nL: Nope. Just a couple of works on Anglo-Saxon grammar. Want those?\nJ: (laughs) I don't think so! I probably need one on English grammar, though. My paper on GM is not organized very well.\nL: GM? General Motors?\nJ: (laughs) No. Gene modification. It's due next Tuesday and I'm barely half-finished. And I need that book to check the pagination- I'm including some quotes out of it.\nL: Well, sorry I can't help- it's just not here. Did you check the stacks?\nJ: Yeah, 'cause I thought at first I'd put it back. But it's not where it's supposed to be, at least.\nL: Maybe somebody else's got it then. Somebody from your class maybe?\nJ: Yeah, maybe. We've all got papers due.\nL: Did you check at the desk? They can tell you if it's been checked out.\nJ: No- it can't be checked out. Our prof put it on reserve until the end of the term. Too many people might need to use it.\nL: And there's only one copy? That's pretty rough.\nJ: Yup, I think so. Or... no- actually, I have no idea. I just presumed there was. I'll go check the catalogue!\nL: Yeah- there might be another one in the Science Reading Room or the Medical Library. You know the author?\nJ: Uh.... Jamison, or um, Jamiston. Why?\nL: Because I can search it for you right now- Google Scholar.\nJ: Huh?\nL: Yeah, haven't your heard? University Libraries has linked up with Google's search of library holdings all over the world\nJ: Wow!\nL: Just a sec. Jamison?....And the title's something about bioengineering, so keyword 'bioengineering'... and- voila! \"Jamison, H.J., Fundamental Concepts of Bioengineering\"- is that it?\nJ: Oh, yes! Great!\nL: And...lessee... Tennyson University....yes, here we are: Main Library- and Medical Research Library! They've got a copy there, too, it says.\nJ: That is really great! Thanks so much for your help. I'm sorry I took up so much of your time. I really appreciate this.\nL: My pleasure. It's my major.\nJ: Huh?\nL: Library Science. You just gave me a little practicum\nJ: (laughs) Well, glad to help, then. I've got to go! The Medical Library closes for the weekend Saturday afternoon.\nL: Better run, then!\nJ: Thanks again! 'Bye.\nL: Good luck!"}
