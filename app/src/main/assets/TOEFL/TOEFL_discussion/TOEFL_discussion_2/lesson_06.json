I didn't hear you come in.\nMarlon: Shower's too loud. Boy, you sure take long ones. Doesn't your mother complain?\nE: Every time. She says I double the water bill.\nM: I can believe it.\nE: But a shower doesn't use nearly as much water as taking a bath does. 'Course, you wouldn't know- you don't use either one.\nM: Haw! You'd know if I didn't. You wouldn't be able to breathe in here right now. What's the occasion?\nE: It's Rush Week, my man. I've got a fraternity to check out tonight. Omega Theta.\nM: Omega Theta? Really? They rushed you? That's a feather in your cap- Everybodys says they're really cool.\nE: Yeah, they are. But they've also got a good reputation for academics, too. They've got the highest GPA on Fraternity Row..\nM: Hmm- that means you're gonna have to keep up your average, too.\nE: Yeah, but I figure that'll be easier to do with a little help from some Omega Theta friends.\nM: You've got friends there?\nE: I will if I join. They've got a pretty strict study regimen: everyone gets assigned a tutor- an upper-class brother- kind of an academic buddy system. They say it works good.\nM: Sounds good if you need that.\nE: And I do. I'm not a self-starter at all. Left to myself, I tend to fiddle around and get nothing done.\nM: Me too, I guess- if I go to the library or the coffee shop to study, I do better, but if I sit around here, I just dawdle. I listen to music or pick at the guitar or, uh, anything to avoid getting down to my assignments.\nE: That's why I think Omega Theta is a good idea.\nM: But what about the really important stuff?\nE: Huh? What's that?\nM: Their parties! They don't have much of a rep as a party house.\nE: No, they don't.\nM: Well? Isn't that the main reason for joining a fraternity- to party and meet girls?\nE: (laughs) For some guys, I guess so, yes. I like to party too, but not every weekend like the Delta Taus do. Now, that's a real animal house- talk about reputation!\nM: Yeah, probably a little much for me, too, when I think about it. We gotta stay a bit serious, after all- we've gotta find jobs when we leave here!\nE: Anyway, Omega Theta does throw a good party or two along the way, just before Christmas and Easter break- and at Halloween, of course.\nM: Oh boy! I hope you'll invite me to that one! I love Halloween parties!\nE: Sure, if I can- but I haven't even been invited to join yet.\nM: Oh yeah, I forgot. Well, I want to hear how it goes tonight.\nE: You bet. Reception's at six-thirty, dinner's at seven. There'll be some talking and a tour of the house and some one-on-one. No alcohol, I think. So I should be back here by nine-thirty or ten at the latest. Then I'll spill all.\nM: Hey! I just thought of something! If you join Omega Theta and move into their house, what am I gonna do for a roommate?\nE: No, no, you're stuck with me for a while yet in any case. They don't have freshman residents, just upper classmen., and not a lot of those. It's not a big house.\nM: How many are staying there anyway?\nE: I dunno- about a dozen or so, I think. I think they've got five or six bedrooms. Everybody else is in the dorms or off campus. But they've got a big hall that'll hold thirty or forty brothers for meetings and cram sessions and things.\nM: Huh! Well, I don't want to hold you up. It's almost six o'clock now.\nE: What? Yipes! I gotta go get dressed and get outta here!\nM: I'll leave you to it. I'm going over to the Campus Club and see if there's a good movie on.\nE: Don't you have anything better to do?\nM: Naw. No one's rushing me tonight. Maybe it's the garlic I ate at lunch.\nE: (laughs) Couldn't be your personality, could it?\nM: Thanks. You're my pal, too. Lock the door when you leave, will you?\nE: Yep. See you about ten?\nM: If the movie's over. If there is one. Otherwise, I'll just be hanging out back here.\nE: OK. See you later.\nM: See you. Have fun!"}
