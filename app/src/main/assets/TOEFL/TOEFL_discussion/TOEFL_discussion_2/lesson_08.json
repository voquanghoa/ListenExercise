Come in, Lisle. I haven't seen you in quite a while, have I? How can I help you?\nL: Well...if you have a few minutes... I need you to help me sort out my credit hours. It's kind of an, uh, an emergency.\nC: OK, sit down. I've got a few minutes right now.\nL: Thanks very much.\nC: So, what's the problem with your credit hours?\nL: Well...um...I think I may not have the right ones. The ones I need to graduate, I mean.\nC: What's your major again? Business Management?\nL: Yeah, it's supposed to be. For Bus Ad, I still need to take Global Economics- EC 303- and, well, I've got room for it in my schedule but, erm...303's got a prerequisite, which I, uh, I haven't taken. EC 203, Econometrics.\nC: Oh, that's just great. How did you manage that, Lisle?\nL: Not paying attention. I didn't notice until now that I needed 303 to graduate, and didn't notice before that I needed 203 before. Is there anything I can do now to fix this?\nC: Well, I'm not sure. It's possible that the dean would let you take them concurrently. It's been done before, in extremis.\nL: Well, that's what I'm in- extremis. The last term before graduation and I'm stuck. Do you think he would, really?\nC: It's possible, if your grades are good enough and everything else is in order. Are they? Is it?\nL: Oh, yeah! My GPA's three point seven. And I've got all the other required credits, and then some- I've actually taken more electives than I need to.\nC: Hmm. Too many electives and missed a prerequisite. Good work, Lisle.\nL: Yeah, pretty dumb, eh?\nC: OK, well- they're both offered this term, I hope?\nL: Oh yes. Global Economics is Tuesday-Thursdays at three pm and Econometrics is the same days at eleven in the morning. Those would work fine, except, uh....\nC: Except what?\nL: Except I've already signed up for the second half of my statistics course- Stats 202- at eleven.\nC: Is that a required course?\nL: No, but it's highly recommended for business majors. And I really need that math. Math is my weak point, I'm afraid, and I'm going to use a lot of it if I go into finance like I want to.\nC: Lisle, do you know what, um, Econometrics is?\nL: Sure! Uh... I guess- what? It's, uh, \"measuring economies\"- \"econo-\" plus \"-metrics\"- isn't it?\nC: It's math, Lisle. Statistics. It's a course in the kinds of statistics used in business, finance, and economics.\nL: Oh!... Oh... so maybe I don't need Stats 202 then?\nC: That's right. Bus Ad makes sure you get the necessary math by requiring Econometrics. But- you've taken Statistics 201 already?\nL: Yes.\nC: Hmm. Listen- there may be another solution to this. The dean might accept Stats 201-202 in place of Econometrics.\nL: Really? That'd be great!\nC: He might. Anyway, I'm going to have to call his office about this- about both possibilities- right away. Let me just see what they say. If you had a choice, which option would it be?\nL: Uh... well, unless they really want me to take Econometrics, I think it would be easier if I completed the second half of my statistics course. I mean, then I'd have the whole course under my belt. But whatever the dean wants- I'm happy to do whatever it takes to graduate on time.\nC: OK, good. Well, with two options, he may be more amenable to exempting you from the prerequisite. Can you bring me a copy of your transcript later today?\nL: I've got one right here, Mrs Morgan. Here you go.\nC: Ah. Mmm. Yes. it does look good, Lisle- three point seven and a good scattering of 'A's, too! OK. I'll arrange to see the dean as soon as I can- if not today, then tomorrow morning, I hope. And we'll try to get this straightened out for you. Stop by tomorrow afternoon about three, will you?\nL: Sure! And thanks. Thank you very much.\nC: OK. And don't worry too much. The dean can be quite flexible in a good cause. See you tomorrow, then.\nL: Thanks so much, Mrs Morgan. See you tomorrow afternoon at three."}
