We're ready to taxi out, but we've been told by the control tower that there's a problem with one of our flaps, so we're going to be delayed a little bit. Mechanics are aboard, and they're examining the situation, so we hope we'll be able to get underway again in just a few minutes. Meanwhile, we've activated the video screens on the seatbacks in front of you, so you can watch movies or enjoy music, and we'll send attendants through the aisles in just a moment with complimentary drinks. On behalf of captain Ronald Sims I apologize for the inconvenience, and once we get this sorted out we anticipate a smooth flight. Thank you for your patience."}
