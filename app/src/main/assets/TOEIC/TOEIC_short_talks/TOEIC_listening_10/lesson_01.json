In a tough economy, we're going to act just like our customers -- tightening our belt and looking for ways to save money. We'll be looking at ways we can conserve energy, operate our stores more efficiently, and integrate new procedures that cut the costs of gas and power. We're also going to re-examine our pricing structure. We might have to lower prices and operate on a thinner profit margin for awhile. We value each and every one of our employees, and we won't let them go until we've first tried everything we possibly can. So I can't promise there won't be layoffs down the road, but your listeners can rest assured that we're committed to trying and avoid them at all costs."}
