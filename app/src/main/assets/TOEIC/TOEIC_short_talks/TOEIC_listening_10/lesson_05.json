Greg, this is Ian Butler from your book club. I'm calling to say that our meeting has been changed this week from Tuesday night to Wednesday night. Also, we're going to meet at Tanya Phelps' house instead of Robin Jones.' Tanya lives at 357 Springfield Lane, and her phone number is 435-8796. The time hasn't changed. The meeting will start at 7, as usual. We're going to be discussing the ending of Moby Dick, so if you haven't finished it yet, you've got an extra day. OK, I guess that's all. See you Wednesday Greg. Bye."}
