This is unbelievable; I'm floored. An individual award always reflects a team effort, and there are so many people who made this moment possible that I don't know where to start, really. I'd like to thank my director, Felix Unger, for believing in me when no-one else did, and my producer, Charleton Hussey, for taking a chance on an unknown name. Renaldo Lopez, my co-star, brought out the best in me, and the whole cast was unbelievably talented. Oh, and I can't forget Sheena Ross, our scriptwriter, who wrote such a fantastic story. Finally, I guess, I'd like to thank my family, who have supported my dream every step of the way. I'm honored to accept this award, not only for myself, but on behalf of everyone in my life who has made my dream come true!"}
