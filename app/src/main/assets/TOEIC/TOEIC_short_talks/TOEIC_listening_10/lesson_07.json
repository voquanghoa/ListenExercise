She wrote a children's book that became an international best-seller and is now a popular movie. Diane Farmer was a stay-at-home mother of three and says she simply \"wanted something to do\" when she began inking The Magic Mushroom four years ago. She wrote the book while waiting to pick up her kids from day care, at night after they were asleep, and in spare moments at basketball games and school plays. Prior to that, Ms. Farmer's only previous writing experience was in a college English class. Now she's already written a sequel due out next month, and is at work on a third book, but she insists that success hasn't changed her. She's still a devoted mother and wife. Ladies and gentleman, please welcome Ms. Diane Farmer!"}
