A check of our real-time monitors reveals the usual rush-hour slowdowns on all major thoroughfares. This accident at the King Street off ramp is adding about 15 minutes to the commute on Interstate 50, but as you can see a tow truck is on the scene and it looks like it'll be cleared soon. On Highway 15, work crews are repaving the right lane near the Hawthorne Creek exit, which is bottlenecking traffic for a couple of miles. If you're heading east right now your best bet is State Route 1, which is starting to flow now that this car that ran out of gas has been moved to the right shoulder. This is Monica Lewis for WING-5."}
