It is 8:45, and we will be closing in 15 minutes. Please bring any items you'd like to purchase to one of the check-out stands. Those already in a check-out line by 9 will be served, but the front doors will be locked at that time, and we will not accept new customers in check-stand lines after 9. Once you have made you purchase, we ask that you exit by one of the two side doors. We thank you for shopping with us tonight, and remind you that we will open tomorrow at 10, and will be open from 10 to 8. Thank you for your cooperation, and have a good night."}
