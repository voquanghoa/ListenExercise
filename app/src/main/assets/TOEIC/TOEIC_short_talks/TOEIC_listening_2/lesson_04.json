Well, summer's over and it's time to break out the umbrellas. As you can see on this KOPS satellite image, a storm front is pushing this way from the coast, bringing heavy rain and winds tonight, followed by afternoon showers tomorrow after some morning clearing. Highs will be 60 degrees today and 65 tomorrow, while lows both days will dive into the low 40s. Looking at the five-day forecast, this high-pressure system moving in from the south will bring more rain later in the week, interspersed with periods of partial clearing. Highs toward the end of the week will inch down toward 60, with lows possibly reaching the mid-30s. As we look out over the eastern part of the state, things look dryer there, with no rain expected and highs holding steady in the mid- to upper-70s for the next week or so."}
