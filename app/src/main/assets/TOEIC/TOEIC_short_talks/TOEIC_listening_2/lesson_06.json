I'm calling to let you know we'll have a truck in your area on the 7th. We accept donations of clean used clothing; curtains and blinds; and blankets and bedding. We also accept small household appliances such as toasters and microwave ovens; cooking utensils; small children's toys; and books and magazines. There is a special need this winter for warm hats and gloves. If you would like to donate, please put your items in a large bag or box, and set them on your front porch or the curb in front of your house by 7 a.m. Wednesday, the 7th. Make sure the bags or boxes are marked \"CC\" in large letters. Our driver will leave you a donation receipt. If you have any questions, please call us at 1-888-555-5353. Thank you, and have a great day!"}
