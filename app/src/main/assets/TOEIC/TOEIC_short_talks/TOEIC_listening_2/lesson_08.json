If hair loss has got you feeling blue, then I've got good news for you. Hair Apparent can restore your hair naturally, without plugs, lotions, or painful surgery. Hair Apparent's experienced doctors combine the use of hair from other parts of your body with their patented growth gel to give you a full, natural-looking head of hair within six- to eight-weeks. My appointment with Dr. Barringer at Hair Apparent was smooth and easy. I relaxed and watched DVD's while Dr. Barringer examined my scalp, then painlessly started treatment. Guys, this was the best decision I have ever made. My nearly bald head is now covered with thick, rich, soft hair that honestly looks better than it did before it fell out. My wife can't believe it! Call Hair Apparent at 555-1209 today for a free consultation, or visit one of their two locations: 123 Main Street downtown or 345 Pine Street on the east side. Tell 'em Pete Patterson sent you, and you'll get 20 percent off. Don't wait! Act now! Trust me, you'll be glad you did."}
