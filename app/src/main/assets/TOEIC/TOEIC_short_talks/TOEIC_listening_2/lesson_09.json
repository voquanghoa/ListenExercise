A couple of problems to report at this hour. A two-car collision is blocking the right lane of Interstate 12 near the Broad Street on-ramp, and traffic there is backed up for about two miles. On Highway 33, a milk truck has overturned near the junction of Holden Road, which has created a parking lot while work crews clear debris from the roadway. Other roads look normal for this time. Interstate 14 slows coming into Millburg, but picks up again near Smithport, and State Route 7 is slow off-and-on from the downtown S-curves through Lake McDonald. If you need to cross the lake right now, both roadways look pretty good, but Interstate 80 is a little bit better bet than State Route 320, where volumes are beginning to build on the west side. This is Mindy Rollins with front-seat traffic."}
