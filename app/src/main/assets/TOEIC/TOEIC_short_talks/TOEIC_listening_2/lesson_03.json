My name's Joe Coleman, and I'll be working in accounting. I grew up in San Diego, and I have a BA in political science from Malibu University. Before coming here to Martz Brothers, I worked six years as an accountant at Marshall & Boyer in Salt Lake City, and for three years as comptroller at the Sexson Company in San Francisco. I've been married for five years now, and we have two kids, ages one and three. My wife, Sarah, worked many years for Lehman and Sons before taking time off to have children. Now she's trying to launch a small public relations company while also being a full-time housewife. For my hobbies, I like reading, swimming, watching movies, and I love football. In fact, I used to play at Malibu."}
