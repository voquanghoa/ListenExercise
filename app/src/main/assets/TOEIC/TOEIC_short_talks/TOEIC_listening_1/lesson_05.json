My dog, Spot, loves to run. The trouble is, she was always running out of our yard into the neighbors' yards. Once, she even ran into the street and nearly got hit by a car! That's when I called my friends at InvisiFence. They came right over, explained their program, and within a couple of hours had erected an invisible barrier around our yard that keeps Spot on our property just like a real fence would. Spot can now run happily around our yard, and me and my family don't have to worry about her running away. She'll go right to the edge of the yard, but won't go past it. The Invisifence process was smooth, quick, and surprisingly affordable -- much cheaper than putting a real fence around my yard would have been. If you're looking for an effective way to keep your dog on your property, call Invisifence now. They're right here in town, at 789-9876. Or, check them out on the web at invisifence.com. Take it from me, you'll be glad you did."}
