Well, if you're on the roads listening to this, you already know that traffic is pretty much a mess everywhere. On Interstate 7, it crawls from downtown to the county line. Vehicles crossing the lake on State Route 50 are gridlocked both eastbound and westbound, and the valley freeway is stop-and-go from Mayberry through Winwood. Highway 17 is slow through the city, then clears out until Overpass Road. If that weren't bad enough, an injury accident is blocking Main Street downtown, causing a 15-minute backup for cars waiting to get onto the freeway. This has been Betty Bellarussa with your 5 p.m. WARP-AM traffic update. Our next traffic report will be at the bottom of the hour."}
