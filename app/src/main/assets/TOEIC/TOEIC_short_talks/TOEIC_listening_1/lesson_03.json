Tayna, my name is Karl Klaussen with Premium Insurance Company. You had asked me to give you a quotation for your 2007 Toyaki Turbo coupe. I've processed your information, and we could insure this vehicle for $600 a year. That's $50 a month, and you have the choice of paying monthly or in advance. This price includes discounts for having a good driving record, and for also having your homeowner's insurance with us as well as your auto insurance. It includes comprehensive coverage, uninsured motorist protection, and up to $50,000 liability. We could begin coverage at the first of next month. If you have more questions I'd be happy to answer them. You can reach me at 590-095-6446 or on my cell at 342-768-0120. Thank you for considering Premium Insurance."}
