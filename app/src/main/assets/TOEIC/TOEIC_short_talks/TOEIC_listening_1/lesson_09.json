It's about 3 on Friday afternoon. Ron, I had something come up at the last-minute, so I won't be able to meet with you and Pete Schilling Monday as we had planned. I'd like to reschedule for later in the week, if that works for you and Pete. I'm available late Tuesday and Thursday afternoons, but early morning Wednesday or Friday would actually be best for me. We could still meet at Pete's office, as we planned, or I'd be able to meet somewhere else if it's more convenient for you. Sorry about the cancellation. Please call me as soon as you can after hearing this. My cell is 886-2468, or you can call my office at 351-9823 and leave a message with my secretary, Crystal Gains. Thanks, Ron. I'll talk to you soon."}
