Our Basic plan has a $1,000 deductible. It includes six doctors' visits a year with a $25 co-pay, and covers all your diagnostic treatments -- x-rays and blood tests, things like that. But it doesn't cover vision check-ups or prescription drugs. Our Plus plan has a $1,500 deductible and gives you the same benefits as the Basic, but also covers prescription drugs and vision. Our Premium plan has a $2,000 deductible and includes all aspects of our Basic and Plus plans. The difference is that it will give you more coverage for major surgeries and life-threatening emergencies -- up to 80 percent coverage for instances that require surgery or prolonged hospital stays. If you go to our website, we have a chart comparing the plans and detailing exactly what each one offers."}
