The soggy week we've been having in the valley promises to get dryer soon. Today we're looking at morning showers with afternoon sun breaks and a high of 55. Tomorrow morning will be partly cloudy, with increasing clearing in the afternoon and a high of 60. Friday looks to be sunny and clear with a high of 70, and that weather should carry over into the weekend. Saturday will be mostly sunny with highs near 70, and Sunday should be sunny and clear with highs soaring to nearly 80 degrees. For KPUT, this is Denise Dinger with valley weather."}
