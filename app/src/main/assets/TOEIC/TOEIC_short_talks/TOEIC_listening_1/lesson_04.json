For those of you taking the 9:45 Starlight Special to Amityville, you will need to exchange your ticket for a boarding pass before you board the train. Boarding passes are available now at the purple booth next to door 9. If you need to buy tickets, come to one of the ticket windows on the east side of the station, or use one of our automated ticket machines located throughout the lobby. Once you have your tickets, each passenger must exchange them for a boarding pass, including young children. When you have obtained your boarding pass, you are ready to access the platform. The train will board through door 9 beginning at approximately 9:15. Thank you."}
