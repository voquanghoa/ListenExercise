Great gas mileage? Reliability? Versatility? Modern styling? No pressure sales and easy financing? If you answered yes to any or all of these questions, then you need to visit Starwood Kyoto. I'm Patty Mahre, owner of Starwood Kyoto, and right now we have bargains on hundreds of vehicles as we clear our storeroom to make way for this year's new models. Kyotos are famous for their high quality and fantastic resale value, and we have 10 different Kyoto models that average more than 30 miles per gallon. At Starwood Kyoto, buying a car is easy, with friendly sales people who don't apply heavy pressure and will actually show you the factory invoice before you buy. Right now we have financing as low as 3.9 percent on all Kyoto vehicles, including trucks and SUVs, and up to $3,000 rebates on selected models. We need to make space for new models, so come visit us today, on Highway 909 in Starwood, just south of the city center off exit 191. Come to Starwood, and drive home happy."}
