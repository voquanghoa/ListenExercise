There will be barbequed hamburgers and hot dogs, as well as watermelon and beverages, and you can meet team players and coaches for autographs and pictures. Tickets are $5 for adults and $3 for children age 12 and under. There will also be special $1 raffle tickets for a chance to win several great prizes. All proceeds will benefit the Children's Cancer Center. You can purchase tickets starting at halftime, either at the ticket booth by tunnel 128, or at the entrance to the tent in the south parking lot. We remind you that if you leave the stadium to get tickets, be sure and get your hand stamped for readmittance. Fans, make your plans now for the Bulldog postgame party, and help support families of children with cancer."}
