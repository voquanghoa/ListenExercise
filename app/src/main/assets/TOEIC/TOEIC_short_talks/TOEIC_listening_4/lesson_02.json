Well, we're starting the week with some fog, but that will burn off by late morning, revealing sunny afternoon skies and a high of close to 65 degrees. Tomorrow will be partly sunny, with a high of about 60, but increasing clouds Tuesday night will bring rain and colder weather later in the week. The chance of rain is 60 percent on Wednesday, increasing to 75 percent Thursday and 90 percent Friday, with highs those days in the mid-50s and lows dropping into the low 40s. It should clear a little by the weekend, with the rain chance falling to 40 percent on Saturday and 20 percent Sunday. Look for partially sunny skies and highs returning to the mid-60s. I'm Tricia Cohen with KRCK Tri-County weather. Stay tuned to KRCK for more classic rock music following a real-time traffic update."}
