We're looking at state patrol officers sweeping glass and debris from that collision over to the side of the road, while the left lane remains closed to traffic. Taking a peek at our eastside real-time camera, we see heavy congestion on Highway 605 east of the convention center, thinning out south of the airport. Traffic on Route 2, meanwhile, looks to be moving steadily until the town of Roserock, where a maintenance crew is fixing a large pothole in the center of the roadway. Finally, looking west along Highway 14, we see a backup near exit 93 that appears to be caused by a dairy truck that has spilled part of its load of milk in the center lane. This is Brandon Bacchio with your WILK traffic report. Now back to you, Eda."}
