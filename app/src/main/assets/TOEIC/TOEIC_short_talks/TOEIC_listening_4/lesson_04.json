My name is Sandra Doeic, and I'm calling on behalf of the National Leukemia Foundation. We desperately need your help this year in our battle to find a cure for leukemia. Your gift of $100, $200 or $300 goes directly to scientific research on this deadly disease, and is completely tax deductible. It might help save the life of a friend or family member one day. Won't you consider donating this year? We realize that times are tough, and any amount, even as small as $5, would be greatly appreciated. To make a pledge to the NLF, please call 800-555-8846 between 8 a.m. and 5 p.m. - that's eastern time - or visit our website at www.nlf.org. If you'd prefer to mail a contribution, you may send it to NLF, 2503 Gates Drive NW, Seattle, WA, 98178. Thank you for your time, Mr. and Mrs. Krawshack, and we hope you will be able to help."}
