Our next guest is, besides a gentleman a scholar, one of my favorite authors of all time. I have actually known Jason Fellows for more than 20 years, dating back to the time we shared a communications course taught by Professor Harold Edmunds at Emeritus University. A former newspaper reporter, Mr. Fellows' 22 novels include 14 number-one best-sellers, and 10 of his stories have been turned into major Hollywood movies. Last year's novel, \"The Third House on the Left,\" won the Pulitzer Prize for fiction as well as the Pen Faulkner Award, making Jason one of only a half-dozen writers to win both of these prestigious honors in the same year. His new book, \"Pony Wars,\" is scheduled for publication late this year. Ladies and gentlemen, please welcome an esteemed writer and dear friend, Mr. Jason Fellows."}
