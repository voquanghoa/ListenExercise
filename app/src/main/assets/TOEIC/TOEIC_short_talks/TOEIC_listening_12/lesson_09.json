At this time, there are three students in the district who have been diagnosed with the chicken flu or have displayed symptoms of it. Those three schools -- Sunrise Elementary, Kennedy Middle School, and Clinton Elementary -- will be closed today and tomorrow as a precautionary measure. All other district schools are open and operating on regular schedule. If your child displays flu-like symptoms, you must keep them home from school. Symptoms include a fever of 102 degrees or higher, sore throat, diarrhea, and persistent coughing. To prevent the flu, make sure your children wash their hands frequently, blow their noses into tissues or handkerchiefs, and get plenty of water and rest. For more information on the chicken flu, contact school district headquarters at 555-9909, or the city public health office at 554-6872. Thank you."}
