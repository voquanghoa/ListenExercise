Sure, it's a tough economy right now. But don't let that dampen your enthusiasm. Tough economies come and go, but graduation comes only once in a lifetime. Seize this moment. Cherish it. This is your time. This is your season. The economy will turn around -- who knows, maybe because of something you do. The glass is half full, people! You're leaving a world that you know, a comfortable, exciting world, to enter another world -- a big, full, breathtaking arena, bursting with opportunity. It's a little scary, but it also should be tremendously exhilarating. Remember that when you first stepped onto this campus, fresh from high school, for many of you it was a moment of great fear and trepidation. Now, that fear is conquered, and you're ready for the next step. Great moments are bred of great opportunity. This is your opportunity. This is your moment. Make the most of it! Thank you."}
