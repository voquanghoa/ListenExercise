As you can see in this video footage, firefighters finally have the forest fire at Mount Capistan under control, and are in the process of extinguishing the final small blazes. Investigators have not yet determined the cause of the fire, which caused an estimated $500 million in damage to homes in the Mount Capistan area. A look at the KPUT weather map shows clouds moving into the area this afternoon and evening, which are expected to bring rain and possible thundershowers. But they should pass through by tomorrow evening, and the weekend is expected to be clear and dry. The stock market is up by 150 points at this hour after hitting a morning low point, marked by the red dot, of minus 35 points. Finally in sports, the Eagles lost 3-2 to Cincinnati yesterday, and have the night off before hosting New York tomorrow. I'm Casey Carpenter for KPUT news."}
