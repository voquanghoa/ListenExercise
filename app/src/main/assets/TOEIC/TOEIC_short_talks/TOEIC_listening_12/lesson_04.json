This is Marcos Hernandez. We met last week at the high-tech conference in Boston. Remember, we had talked about getting together to discuss your idea for a start-up Internet business. Well, I'll be in town next week with my associate, James FitzPatrick, and I was hoping we could arrange a meeting, maybe for dinner or cocktails or something. We arrive late Tuesday night, and will be there for three days. We'll be tied up in meetings most of the day Wednesday and Thursday morning, but would have time Wednesday evening, Thursday afternoon, or most of the day Friday. I hope one of those times will work for you. Anyway, could you please call me on my cell when you get a chance? It's 881-555-6300. If you can't reach me, call my office at 881-503-2735 and leave a message with my secretary. Her name is Teresa Guenther. Thanks, Brad. I look forward to hearing from you. Bye."}
