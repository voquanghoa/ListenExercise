Interstate 1 northbound is a mess from the city center to the county line due to an earlier two-car crash in the center lane. Southbound Highway 3 is a virtual parking lot from Evergreen Street through downtown, then clears until Spruceville, where it's stop-and-go from Spruceville to the southern county line. Elsewhere, traffic is flowing smoothly except on eastbound State Route 440, where an overturned semi truck has traffic backed up from the Lake Bridge onramp to mid-span of the bridge. This has been Christy Christian for WUMP 97-point-3 FM. The next traffic update will be at the top of the hour. Now, back to the music with Steve Sarkonian."}
