Stephen, my name is Ted Wilcox, and I'm calling about the 2006 Hyashi four-door sedan that you have advertised on the Auto Deals website. You said your Hyashi has only 20,000 miles on it. I'm wondering if you're the original owner, and also if those are mostly highway miles or city miles? I'd also like to know if it's been in any accidents. I'm very interested in looking at it and taking a test drive. I'm available tonight and all day tomorrow, and I live in the north part of town, not far from you. If it's still available, could you please call me at 555-8448? That's my home number. My cell phone is 555-4884. Again, my name's Ted, and I hope to hear from you soon. Thanks. Goodbye."}
