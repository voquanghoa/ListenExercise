Our top story is the visit of President Lincoln today. The president's plane, Air Force One, is scheduled to arrive at 3 p.m. at Boring Field. President Lincoln will speak at a 6 p.m. rally at the civic center before attending a private fund-raising dinner. Also, we're keeping an eye on the approaching winter storm which is headed toward our way. Forecasters predict it will hit the city late Saturday night, bringing snow and wind gusts up to 70 mph. In sports, the Thunderbirds need a victory at New England on Sunday to reach the play-offs. Kick-off is at 1 p.m. right here on WOK 770 AM sports radio. I'm Kendra Walker, reminding you to add fiber to your diet with Fiber Bread, available at all area Green Grocer stores."}
