Hello. This is Fiona. I hope you're on your way, because you know, it's like, 2:30, and you said you'd meet us at 2 so we'd have time for lunch and to get to the movie on time. So we're wondering where you are. Hope everything's OK, and I'll try you on your cell phone too. If you get this, remember that I have a new cell phone number. It's 554-8448. You could also try Ronni on her cell: 555-6509. Me, Ronni and Chris are here at the restaurant, and we're waiting on you before we order. But if we don't hear from you in about five minutes, we're going to go ahead and order something, because we don't want to miss the start of the movie. OK, Maria, hope to hear from you soon. Bye!"}
