Here's some bread and water to get you started. My name's Chad, and I'll be your waiter tonight. Our specials tonight are lobster Newburg with clam chowder, and swordfish with red potatoes. The drink list is at the back of the menu, appetizers are at the front, and entrees are listed on page three. I'll be back in a few moments to take your order. In the meantime, feel free to help yourself to our all-you-can-eat salad bar. Do you have any questions I can answer for you right now? No. OK, if you have any after you've looked over the menu, feel free to ask. Now then, can I bring you something to drink while you decide?"}
