My name's Lucy Miranda, and this is my fifth year teaching literature at State College. I grew up in the Los Angeles area, and got my BA degree at Cal Poly-Pomona. I then earned a master's in literature from UCLA. I worked as a journalist for a few years, and tried my hand at writing poetry and a couple of novels. My second novel, \"LA Life,\" was published by a small firm, but I had decided by that time that I wanted to teach writing. I taught in high schools in Southern California for six years, then at a junior college. Finally, I was hired at San Diego State University, and was there for four years before coming here. I was married four years ago, and I have a three-year-old daughter, Theresa, and a six-month-old son, Antonio. OK, now I'd like to know a little about each of you."}
