Elsewhere it looks pretty good, with volumes on northbound Interstate 6 beginning to build up here, near Headport, and again here south of the city near Duwamps. A check of the KAPE real-time camera shows a smooth commute at this hour through downtown Floss. Now, switching to the eastside camera, we can see a stalled vehicle backing up traffic on State Route 7. But I see flashing lights, so help is on the scene. That's traffic at this hour, still pretty light but starting to build. I'm Ross Dinsmore for KAPE news."}
