There is a car in the east parking lot that's blocking a stadium emergency exit. The car is a blue Toyonka coupe, license plate number YFG643. We need the owner to move the car immediately, or else it will be towed. Fans, we remind you to please respect the no-parking signs posted in emergency zones. These zones are marked with yellow stripes, and they are to be kept open at all times for emergency trucks and personnel. In an actual emergency situation, anyone parked in an emergency zone at the stadium is subject not only to a $200 fine, but can also be held liable for the condition of a person who needs emergency help, and could face up to 90 days in jail. We thank you for your cooperation in this matter, and hope you enjoy the rest of the game."}
