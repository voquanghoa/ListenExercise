I am tied up in court this morning and will not be returning voice-mail messages, but your phone call is important to me. I will check my messages and return phone calls in the afternoon. Unless this is an emergency, please do not leave a message at this time. Try again after 1 o'clock. If this is an emergency, page me at 555-364-7849, and I'll get back to you during a court recess. If you would like to schedule an appointment, please call my secretary, Donna Fortner, at 555-683-1037. My soonest available openings are next week on Wednesday. Goodbye for now, and thank you for calling."}
