At the weekend, though, clouds will be moving in on the north part of the coast. The temperatures there will drop into the low 70s, with showers on Saturday and possible thunder storms on Sunday. On the south coast, the sun should continue through the weekend, with highs in the middle 80s. At the start of next week, we expect some clearing in the north, with rain in the mornings and partly sunny skies in the afternoons. The highs in the north will gradually climb into the 80 again by this time next week. In the south, next week looks to be much like this one has been so far."}
