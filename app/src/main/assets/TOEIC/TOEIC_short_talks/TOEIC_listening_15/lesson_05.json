We have an outstanding lineup this season, which kicks off tonight with a 21st century adaptation of Shakespeare's classic, \"Romeo and Juliet.\" At this time I would like to turn the microphone over to the author of this production, Martin Bourgette. Mr. Bourgette is renowned for putting fresh spins on classic tales, as he did at last year's festival with an updated version of \"Taming of the Shrew.\" Martin started his drama career right here in Muston, earning his first starring role in our outdoor festival at age 14. He appeared in several other festival plays before majoring in drama at Muston University. For the past 10 years, he has tried his hand at writing and directing, earning nationwide acclaim -- and a fair share of criticism -- for his unique perspectives and modern renderings of many classic plays. \"Romeo and Juliet\" is Mr. Bourgette's 21st stage production, and his fourth for our festival. Ladies and gentlemen, please welcome Martin Bourgette."}
