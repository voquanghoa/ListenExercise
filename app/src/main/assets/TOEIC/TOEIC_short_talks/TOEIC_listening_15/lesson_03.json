Starting next month, instead of cubicles, we will have an open office. There will be no cubicle walls or partitions. Instead, desks will be arranged in clusters for each department. The desks in each department will be facing each other in clusters of four or six. We feel this will facilitate better communication between workers in each departments. It will also create a more welcoming environment for clients. The department managers will still have their own offices, but each will have large windows and glass doors, to make employees and clients feel welcome to come inside. We're also going to paint the walls and put in new carpeting. The project will start on the first of next month and should take about three weeks to complete. We will be moving to the third floor during that period."}
