Wouldn't you rather be sitting in a plush seat, reading a good book or sipping a cold drink while you wait? You could, you know, if you were riding a County Transit bus or light-rail train. Light-rail trains run twice daily north-south and east-west during rush hour periods, with 12 convenient stops along the way. And there are now more County Transit buses, and bus routes, than ever before. Recent studies show that taking a bus or train, instead of driving, could save you up to $10,000 a year. That's money that could be used for vacation, that new kitchen you've been wanting, or to help your children go to college. Studies also show that trains and buses, on average, get you to work and back quicker than cars do. So what are you waiting for -- besides that car bumper just ahead of you to finally move? Climb aboard a County Transit bus or light-rail train. Then relax, and leave the driving to us. For more information, call 1-800-TRANSIT, or visit us online at www.countytransit.com."}
