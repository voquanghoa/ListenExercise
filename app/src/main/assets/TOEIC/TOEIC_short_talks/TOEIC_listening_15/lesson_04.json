Due to our airport expansion project, please note the following changes. All domestic departures will board in the main terminal building, at gates A, B, and C. All domestic arrivals will deplane outside the airport tarmac, and passengers will be bussed into the main terminal. International flights will depart and arrive at the annex terminal, gates D, E, F, and G. To get to the annex terminal, take the airport subway, which boards in the lower level near gate A. It leaves every 10 minutes. We thank you for your patience as we expand the airport to serve you better. Expansion work will last approximately 10 weeks. For more information about the project, visit one of the information kiosks located throughout the airport, or call our special hotline at 888-555-7473."}
