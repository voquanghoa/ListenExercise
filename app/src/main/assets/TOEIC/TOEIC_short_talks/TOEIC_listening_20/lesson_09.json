If you need to buy tickets for the light-rail train, use the automated ticket machines located just inside the main doorway, or go to one of the booths on the left side of the main lobby. There are rail route maps and information about the light-rail system at the kiosks on both the main and lower floors. Passengers traveling on the blue track should go downstairs and board on the right. Passengers for the yellow and red tracks will board downstairs on the left. There are wheelchair-accessible ramps next to the stairs, and an elevator along the rear wall. Trains will arrive and depart every 10 minutes, so if you miss your first train, don't worry. There is free coffee, hot chocolate and donuts today on the upper level for your enjoyment. At 1 o'clock, there will be a ribbon-cutting ceremony with Mayor Greg Nicholas outside the front doors, to celebrate the grand-opening of this station. We hope you will enjoy your light-rail experience. If you need any assistance, look for one of the workers wearing a yellow jacket. They'll be happy to answer your questions and help guide you. You can also learn more about the new city light-rail system and this station online at www.cityrail.com. Thank you for choosing Metro light rail."}
