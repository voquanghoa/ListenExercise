It stands for Quality, Value and Service. I want this motto to guide our training program every step of the way. Whatever specific skill we're learning, or whatever project we're working on, I want you to ask yourselves, \"How will this result in higher-quality products, better value for our customers, and a speedier delivery?\" I want the letters QVS to be imprinted on your brain. We will offer four special training classes this year. The first is called Leadership Style, and it's for everyone. The second is called Leading in a QVS World, and it's for those of you who head up our manufacturing plants. The third is Passport, for young workers whom management has identified as having high potential. And the fourth is Leading the Way, for our executives and senior leaders. These classes are designed to help fulfill our corporate objectives for this year: To focus our revenue growth, expand our global presence, drive our QVS management system, and build organizational capability. We want to create a culture where we are always learning and engaged in continuous improvement, and where we achieve our business objectives through disciplined thought, action, and collaboration in an entrepreneurial environment."}
