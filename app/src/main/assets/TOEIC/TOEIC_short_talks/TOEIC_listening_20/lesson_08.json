I tried to call Felix, but it said that his number was disconnected. Maybe I copied it down wrong. When you get a chance, could you please check it and then call me and leave a good number for him? Thanks. Also, I reached Mr. Latimer, and he said to go ahead and order a dozen boxes of the new business cards. You can charge them to the company. We'll need to meet sometime next week to discuss the Gerber project. I'm going to be out of the office this morning, but I'll be at my desk most of the afternoon, or you could try my cell: 555-844-9122. Let me know which days are good for you. And if you could get me that number for Felix as soon as possible, I'd appreciate it. Thanks Trudy. Talk to you soon. Bye."}
