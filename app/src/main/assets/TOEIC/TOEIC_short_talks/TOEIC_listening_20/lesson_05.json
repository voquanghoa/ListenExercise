You asked where our opportunity was. It's in customer service, because if we can provide a higher level of certainty in a world that is uncertain, that gives us a competitive advantage. For example, we're doing a \"back to the future\" on the charge card. That's our pay-in-full product at the end of 30 days. Consumers want discipline, and if we can bring that discipline of paying in full at the end of the month along with the service levels that we provide, plus the rewards and other programs we have, we think that's a tremendous opportunity for us to grow. We also believe there are substantial opportunities in partnering with banks to issue Vista-branded credit cards, and we've had very strong success doing it globally. Another area we feel strongly about is that we have information we can use in very effective ways for a range of partners. We believe that our information, which we use in our own business and marketing, can be used by retailers, restaurants, and other corporations to improve their business, and that's an increasing area of focus for us."}
