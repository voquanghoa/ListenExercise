I'm Cindy Cowherd in the Dick's Traffic center. Southbound Interstate 9 is busy from the county line to the downtown convention center, and again from South Street to Maple Hill. Northbound 9 starts to slow near Gigantic Mall, and is heavy from there all the way to Shoreview Heights. On eastbound Route 222, traffic is flowing again across the bridge now that an earlier accident has been cleared to the side. On west 222, we're getting reports of a stalled car blocking the right lane of the First Avenue on-ramp. Traffic is backed up along First Avenue to the scene. Otherwise, the roads look pretty good, and there are no blockages to report at this time. WPMZ traffic reports are sponsored by Dick's Delis. Come into Dick's this weekend for $2 off a large submarine sandwich, or $3 off any lunch combination plate. This is Cindy Cowherd from the Dick's traffic center."}
