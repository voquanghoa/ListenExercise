Then don't miss the huge sale this weekend at Coat Warehouse. We're taking 10 to 50 percent off our already low prices for winter coats, jackets, hats, mittens, and scarves -- everything you need to be warm and cozy when the temperatures drop and the snow starts falling. We have brand-name clothes at a fraction of the cost you'll find them selling for in other stores, with the city's largest selection of sizes and styles. This weekend, from Friday through Sunday, is your chance to save even more! Products marked with red tags are reduced anywhere from 10 to 50 percent, and products with green tags will get you discount coupons that can be used at a future date. Also, the first 100 customers will receive a set of super-warm earmuffs absolutely free! So mark your calendars, folk. Coat Warehouse has two locations, at Southgate Mall and downtown on the corner of First and Pike. The first 100 customers at each location will get a set of free earmuffs. We're open 9-9 on Friday and Saturday, and 9-6 on Sunday. Don't be left out in the cold this winter. Get down to Coat Warehouse for our huge winter sale!"}
