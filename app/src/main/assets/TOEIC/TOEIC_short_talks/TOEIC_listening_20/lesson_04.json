My name is Shirley Preston, and I'm the corporate communications officer for Furniture City Inc. I am pleased to announce that we will be opening a new Furniture City store this April at 53 Parkway Street, opposite the Parkway Mall. This will be our third location in the city, and our largest store yet, with 6,000 square feet. Our stores are renowned for providing quality furniture at reasonable prices, and this store will be no exception. It will employ 30 persons, and we expect it to generate more than $2 million a year for the city in tax revenue. This is another measure of the growth of Furniture City, which began four years ago in a small office on Clark Street. Maurice Alberts, our founder and president, has expanded the company in the space of that time to one of the fastest-growing firms in our state. Revenues for Furniture City rose 10 percent last year, and are up to 2 percent for the first quarter of this year. In addition to this new store, we have plans to expand soon into other cities in the state. At this time, I will field any questions that you have, either about our new store or our company in general."}
