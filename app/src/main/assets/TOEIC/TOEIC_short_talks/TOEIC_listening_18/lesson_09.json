There is a huge backup right now on the interstate freeway southbound near the Fifth Street exit, due to a car-truck collision. Police and aid cars are on the scene, and it looks like it's going to take awhile to clear it up. The right two lanes are blocked, but the two left lanes are open, and there's a police officer directing vehicles. Northbound traffic on the interstate is also bottle-necking through that area as drivers slow to take a look. But that congestion should ease in a few minutes, as we see traffic authorities getting ready to switch the special express lanes from southbound to northbound at 3:30. Traffic on other major roadways looks normal at this hour. This is Abby Adams from the WJAM eye in the sky.
