My name's Randy Hornbaker, the emcee for tonight's program, and it's my privilege to introduce our featured speaker, Mr. Christopher Sparks. Ten years ago, Christopher started bottling tea that was based on his grandmother Tina's recipe. If you haven't heard of Tina's Tea yet, you soon will. Last year Mr. Sparks signed a distribution agreement with a national distributor, and soon Tina's Tea will be a household name. Tonight Christopher, who's only 24, will discuss what it's like to be successful at such a young age, and where he will take his young company from here. Mr. Sparks will speak for about 60 minutes. Please save all your questions for the end of his speech, when there will be a 30-minute question-and-answer session. If you have a question for Christopher at that time, raise your hand, and one of our ushers will bring you a wireless microphone so that everyone in the room will be able to hear you. So without further ado, please welcome Mr. Christopher Sparks."}
