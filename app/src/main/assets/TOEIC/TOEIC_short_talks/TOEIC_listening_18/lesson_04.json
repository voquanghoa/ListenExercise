Face the tough decisions, but don't let cutbacks stop you from seeing the windows of opportunity that are suddenly open. For example, we've seen research that only 13 percent of people who tighten their budget will go back to their old spending habits when the economy improves. This was a great chance for our company to make explicit what we knew implicitly: Our products are a great value. So we spent money for a new advertising campaign with phrases like \"Quality for less,\" \"shop smart,\" and \"style on a budget.\" As a result, our sales have increased each of the past three quarters. Think creatively. Act aggressively. We can't predict exactly when the broad economy will recover, but your company's recovery can begin whenever you're ready. Don't wait; innovate!"}
