Not with Porta-Trainer! No, Porta-Trainer is not a personal trainer, but it IS a complete workout, and it fits in a bag smaller than you'd usually carry to the gym. This amazing, lightweight device has everything you need to strengthen your arms, legs, belly, shoulders, chest and thighs in just minutes a day. It's so simple, it just hooks up to a doorknob, hook, or hanger. The tough, flexible bands stretch as far as you can pull them, offering maximum resistance that builds muscles and tones fat fast! But the most amazing thing about Porta-Trainer is the price. Normally Porta-Trainer sells for $59.99. But if you order right now, by calling the number at the bottom of your screen, Porta-Trainer can be yours for only $29.99 -- less than one month's dues at most health clubs! But wait, there's more. If you call in the next 10 minutes, we'll throw in this beautiful Porta-Trainer tote bag, as well as this instructional video, absolutely free! This is a $100 value! Don't wait. Call now. Have your credit card ready; operators are standing by. Now you CAN get fit, in the comfort of your own home, workplace or hotel room, in just minutes a day!"}
