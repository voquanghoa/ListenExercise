There will be four acts, with a 20-minute intermission. If you don't have a program, they're available for free at either of the booths at the side of the stage. During the show, we ask that you remain seated on the grass or in lawn chairs, and please keep children behind the yellow rope lining the front of the stage. If your little one needs to use the restroom, it would be a good idea to take them now. Restrooms are located in the fenced area to the right of the stage. Also, if you're in contact with friends and family who are still arriving, tell them the north lot is full, but there is additional parking in the east and west lots. When the curtain drops to signal the start of the action, please turn off all your cell phones and pagers, and be considerate of your neighbors. Thank you for coming, and we hope you enjoy it!"}
