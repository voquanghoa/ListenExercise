You had a couple of questions about the bid we gave you to remodel your office. First, yes, the quote to enlarge the conference room does include installing new carpet. Sorry if that wasn't clear on the spreadsheet. You had also asked why we quoted a range for the cost of lighting. That's because it depends on the type and style of lights you decide you want. The low figure is for standard lighting, and the high one is for fancy, canned track lights. As for painting, we subcontract that, so I'll have to check with my painters and see when they can come give you an estimate -- hopefully by the end of the week. I'll get back in touch with you about that later today. If you have more questions, give me a call or shoot me an e-mail. My cell phone is 344-612-0985, and the office is 344-555-7249. E-mail is josh at levine dot com. Otherwise, I'll put you in touch with the painters and wait to hear from you. Thanks Ms. Whitehurst, and have a good day!"}
