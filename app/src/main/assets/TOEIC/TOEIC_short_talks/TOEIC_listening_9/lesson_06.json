My name's Trevor Kline, and I'm president of Freedom International. It's my exceedingly great privilege tonight to introduce this year's keynote speaker. What can I say about Arthur Davis? This is difficult, because Art has been a mentor to me -- more than a mentor, really -- a brother, friend, and confidant. He helped start Freedom International, along with Roger Montoya, and it's due mostly to his great charisma, drive, and wisdom that we have enjoyed so much success. Through the years, Art has been a steadying influence and a guiding light. Even after he left Freedom International five years ago for private business, he has maintained a keen interest and always been, and continues to be, more than generous with his support and advice. Would you please join me in welcoming Mr. Arthur Davis!"}
