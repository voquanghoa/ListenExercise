It's time for tonight's \"Lucky Fan\" drawing. If your ticket stub is called, you'll receive a wonderful prize package consisting of a team jacket, an autographed team poster, a $50 gift certificate to Big Steaks Restaurant, and two tickets to an upcoming game. OK, get your stubs out. Tonight's winner is sitting in section 28, row G, seat 202. Congratulations! There she is, on the jumbo screen! To claim your prize, bring your ticket stub to the fan information booth adjacent to tunnel 28 before the end of the game. The rest of you, remember to keep your ticket stub from tonight's game. It entitles you to $5 off a regular wash and wax at any Red Panda Car Wash location."}
