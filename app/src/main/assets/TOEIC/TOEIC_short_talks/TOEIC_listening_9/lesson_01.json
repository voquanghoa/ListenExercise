This is something that 20 years ago I never imagined I'd be doing. I came from a poor family, and when I finished high school I didn't think I'd be able to go to college. But I kept applying to universities, and finally, I found one -- Carver University -- that offered me a scholarship. This changed my life. Without that experience, there is no way I'd have ever gotten a job at the Cornerstone Company, let alone be standing here as company president. Now it's overwhelming to be back at Carver, looking at the faces of so many eager men and women who are anxious to get out there and make a difference. My message to you is: never give up. Ever. Dreams can come true. I'm living proof."}
