My name's Andy Smith, and I'm calling about your ad in the Weekly for a roommate. I'm very interested, and I'd like to meet you and see the apartment as soon as I could. I'm new in town, and I moved here because I have a job with Boogle starting next week. I'm 25, a non-smoker, very reliable, and I have references from my previous landlord, Gil Harmon. If you'd like to call Gil before you talk to me, his number is 555-876-0987. Again, my name is Andy, and you can reach me on my cell at 519-623-8651, or you could call me at my hotel: 519-805-2123, room 207. Thanks, Liam. I hope to hear from you soon. Bye."}
