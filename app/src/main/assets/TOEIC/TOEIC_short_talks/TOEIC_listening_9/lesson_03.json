Both major freeways are moving pretty well at this point. The only problem is a slowdown on Interstate 9 near La Hoya Street caused by a stalled vehicle in the right lane. State Route 6 is bumper-to-bumper from downtown through Buenos Verdes due to an earlier car-truck collision that has just been cleared to the shoulder, and State Route 12 is backing up near Mid-Town, where work crews are fixing potholes in the left lane. I'm Stacy Wilcox. Stay tuned for WANG news and weather after this word from our sponsor."}
