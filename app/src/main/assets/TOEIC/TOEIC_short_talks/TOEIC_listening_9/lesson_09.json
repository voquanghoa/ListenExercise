We will have a truck in your neighborhood next Tuesday, the 13th. We're looking for donations of clean used clothing, cookware, household utensils, and books and games in good condition. We cannot accept computers or large appliances. We ask that you place donated items on your front porch or the curb in front of your house, set them out by 7 in the morning on the 13th, and mark them \"CS\" in large letters. We will pick them up sometime between 7 and 5, and will leave a receipt for tax purposes. If you have any questions or want to schedule a pickup for a different date, please call 672-910-4455 between 8 a.m. and 5 p.m. Monday through Friday. Thank you, and have a great day."}
