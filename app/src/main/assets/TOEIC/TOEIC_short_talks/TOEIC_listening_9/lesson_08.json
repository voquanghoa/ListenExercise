An offshore front is blowing these clouds our way, as you can see, and that means rain starting this afternoon and continuing for the next few days. We can expect overcast skies, with heavy rain at times and wind gusts up to 30 miles an hour. Highs should reach the mid-60s, with lows in the low-50s through Friday. We should have partial clearing on the weekend, and be back to sunny skies by this time next week after the front has passed through. Looking at the regional weather map, it looks to remain sunny and clear east of the mountains, with highs in the mid-70s and lows in the mid-40s. The southern part of the state will receive mixed sun and rain, with partly cloudy days and highs in the 60s."}
