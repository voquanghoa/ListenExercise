Today we're unveiling a new piece of art: a life-size statue of our city founder, Chief Nokahoma of the Dumammish Tribe. The funding for this project was courtesy of a donation from the Historical Museum, and the statue was sculpted by a local artist, Mr. Kyle Chamberlain. We are honored to have Mr. Chamberlain with us this afternoon. Kyle is a native of our state, and moved to our city when he was 16. He comes from a family of artists, and graduated from the New York Institute of Art. He has been sculpting statues ever since. His work is displayed at the downtown art museum, as well as several other museums around the country. Today Kyle will tell you about carving this statue from an old portrait of Chief Nokahoma, a process which took 18 months. Please join me in welcoming Mr. Kyle Chamberlain!"}
