If you're thinking of buying a new car, now's the time! We have an outstanding selection of new vehicles, and thanks to government incentives, prices have never been better. You can get $900 off a brand new pickup truck, or drive home in a new four-door sedan for only $12,500 after a $2,000 government rebate. That's right, up to $2,000 off hundreds of new cars and trucks! And if you have an old clunker that gets less than 20 miles per gallon, bring it down and trade it in. Not only will we give you a great price for that gas guzzler, we'll also give you an extra $1,000 off the price of a new vehicle under the government's \"cash for clunkers\" program. But you'd better get a move on. Prices this low won't last long. We're on Tri-Cities Motorway near the junction of Interstate 40. Right now we're open 9 to 9 Monday through Friday, and 8-10 on Saturday and Sunday. Tell them Tammy sent you, and we'll give you your car's first oil change for free!"}
