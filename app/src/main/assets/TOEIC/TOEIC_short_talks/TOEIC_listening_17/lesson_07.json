I've got good news! I closed the deal here in Dallas early, so I can be back tomorrow in time to make the meeting with the clients from Seoul. I'm catching a red-eye flight back to Atlanta. The only problem is, I arrive early in the morning, and my wife has to use our car to take the kids to school and get to work. So I need a ride from the airport to my house, and then into the office so I can make the meeting at 9. Oh, I also need for Erika to set up my power-point presentation and get it ready for the meeting. Could you please ask Antonio if he could pick me up at the airport? I know he lives near there. I arrive on Flight 397 from Dallas at 7 a.m. Thanks a lot Rebecca. If there are any problems, call me on my cell. Otherwise I'll see you tomorrow morning."}
