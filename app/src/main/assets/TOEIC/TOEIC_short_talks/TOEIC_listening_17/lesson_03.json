Volume on the two major east-west roadways, Interstate 50 and Highway 44, is very heavy this afternoon as people head out of town for the holiday weekend. There are no accidents on either road, but on Interstate 50 there is a 90-minute delay getting over the mountain pass. North-south traffic looks good at this hour. Interstate 3 is mostly clear in both directions, with a little slowing northbound near the City Center exit due to an earlier two-car collision that has been moved off to the shoulder. We're getting reports now of a backup on Highway 10 southbound near Rodgers Street, where some furniture has fallen off the back of a pickup truck in the far left lane. Police are on the scene, helping the driver pick everything up. This is Tom Moran from the KST-AM traffic center, which provides traffic updates every 20 minutes."}
