After considering several factors, including the questionnaires you completed last spring, we've decided that we're going to switch to four-day workweeks, beginning next month. We will work 10 hours a day, from 7 a.m. to 6 p.m., on Monday through Thursday. The office will be closed Fridays. Though we will still work 40 hours a week, we estimate that this change will reduce our energy use by 15 percent, and will also save each of you, on average, about $20 a month in gas and transportation costs. Overall, this change will significantly cut our company's greenhouse transmissions and reduce our carbon footprint. To save even more energy, we will be installing compact fluorescent light bulbs -- CFLs -- in every light socket at the start of next week. During the changeover period, we understand that some of you, particularly those with young children, might need special accommodations as you adjust to a four-day week. If you have troubles or concerns, let your manager know. We'll be happy to help you any way we can. Though this might be traumatic at first, we're confident that most of you will like the new schedule once you've grown accustomed to the change."}
