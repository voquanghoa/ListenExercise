What came out of the Army was that the level of excellence you should hold yourself to should be very high. At McCamry, what I learned was how to make complex concepts simple and communicate them so people can understand them quickly, and make the right decisions. At Corporate Electric, I learned how to be a general manager. It was the best factory I ever saw for that. I spent time on the staff of CEO Bishop Walsh, and watching him up close showed the power of being adaptive, aggressive, and competitive -- but still, as he always said, we can be hard-hearted in business yet softhearted when it comes to taking care of people. My life experience has taught me there's no substitute for surrounding yourself with the best team. So in this position, I've tried to assemble the best possible team I can find. Because our team is good, our expectations are high. We expect exceptional results."}
