Firefighters now say they have the wildfire burning in the eastern foothills under control. The blaze, which has been raging for three days, destroyed nearly 500 acres of land and damaged 10 homes. No injuries have been reported. Fire chief Mike Montgomery said the department is still investigating the cause of the fire, and it's too early to determine if it was set intentionally. Montgomery said fires start easily in this dry weather, and cautioned people again to be very careful with matches and lighters. Campfires have been banned in the eastern foothills, where the fire danger is high, but are still allowed in the northern and western foothills, where the fire danger is currently rated medium. Montgomery said it will take crews another day or two to completely douse the flames, and then cleanup will begin. The city estimates that clean-up costs could exceed $3 million. This has been Wendy Wilkens for the 5 p.m. news."}
