This is a special announcement from the front desk at Saint Marion's Hospital. We want to remind all visitors to use the east entrance door this week while the main lobby inside the west entrance door on Main Street is being repainted. The east hospital entrance is located on Border Street, and it is open each day during regular visiting hours, which are 8 a.m. to 9 p.m. Monday through Saturday, and 7 a.m. to 7 p.m. on Sundays. If you need to enter the hospital during non-visiting hours, please use the north entrance, located on First Street. The west entrance door will re-open one week from today. Thank you for your patience during this phase of our lobby improvement project."}
