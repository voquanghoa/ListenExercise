My name is Linda Layman, and it's a great privilege for me to welcome our keynote speaker this evening, Samuel Jamison. Mr. Jamison, as you all know, is CEO of Beta Soft Corporation, and is regarded as the country's Most Creative Entrepreneur by the American Business League. In addition to that award, he has earned Wealth Magazine's \"Man of the Year\" award two times, and, last year, he was named \"CEO of the Decade\" by Business News Magazine, the first CEO that Business News has ever honored from our state. Mr. Jamison has grown Beta Soft from a two-person organization headquartered in his garage to a multi-billion dollar, multinational corporation in only 10 short years. You all know that. What you might not know is that Mr. Jamison founded two businesses that failed prior to Beta Soft, and that starting his third - and most successful - venture was actually his wife's idea. Ladies and gentlemen, join me in giving a big hand to our keynote speaker, Mr. Samuel Jamison."}
