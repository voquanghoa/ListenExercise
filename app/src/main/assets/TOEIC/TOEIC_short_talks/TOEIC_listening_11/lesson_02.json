The center is open to employees' children between the ages of 2 and 5. Starting next Monday, eligible employees can drop off their youngsters at the day-care center beginning at 7 a.m., and pick them up no later than 6 p.m. The cost is $20 an hour per child, and includes lunch and snacks. For those who work part-time, half-day and drop-in options are available. Our center features six experienced teachers, and includes modern play equipment and learning materials. It has 3,000 square feet, including a main play area, a lunch room, and three separate class rooms: one for two- and three-year-olds, one for four-year-olds, and one for five-year-olds. Don't worry, moms and dads. Your children will be safe, warm, and, best of all, nearby! You are welcome to visit them on the third floor during lunch hour and work breaks."}
