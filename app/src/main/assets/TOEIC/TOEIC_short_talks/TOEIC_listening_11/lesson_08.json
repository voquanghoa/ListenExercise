Hurricane Harry is moving south-southeast about 25 miles off the Florida Coast, and is predicted to strike southern Florida early this evening. Winds are forecasted to be 75- to 100-miles an hour, with ocean swells up to 10 feet high. Florida authorities have ordered residents of coastal cities to evacuate their homes for the next 24 hours, and two units of the National Guard have been dispatched to assist elderly and disabled residents. Forecasters at the national weather center have labeled Harry a level-2 hurricane, and say it might decrease to level-1 by the time it reaches land. Residents of islands in the Florida Keys have also begun evacuating in case Harry suddenly veers farther south. This is Mitch Bloomfield reporting for WROJ. The next update will be at top of the hour, or whenever news breaks on news radio WROJ, 920 a.m."}
