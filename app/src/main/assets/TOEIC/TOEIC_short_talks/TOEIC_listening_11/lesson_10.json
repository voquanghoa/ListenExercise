We're down, but we're far from out. This is not over yet! The main thing, I think, is you've got to settle down out there and keep your heads in the game. We've played a half, so all the jitters should be gone and we should be into it now, right? Guys, just go out there and play, and stop thinking so much. I've seen you at practice, and I know you can do this! When the going gets tough, the tough get going! You guys are tough! If we play our game, we'll be fine. We're better than them, and we can win this thing! Think about your assignments, and carry out your assignments on each play. Don't worry about making a mistake, just play your hardest and concentrate on doing your job. You know what you've got to do, now get out there and do it! Let's go!"}
