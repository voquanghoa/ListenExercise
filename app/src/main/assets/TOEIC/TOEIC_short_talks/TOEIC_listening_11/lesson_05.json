My name is Janelle Archer from Lincoln Bank, and you had called us asking about interest rates for our CDs and money market accounts. Our current top CD rate is 5 percent for 48 months, with a minimum investment of $5,000. We also offer a CD of 4 percent for 36 months, with a minimum of $2,000. To purchase either of these CDs, you must first have a Lincoln Bank checking account. Our money market account is currently paying an interest rate of 3.50 percent. You don't need a previous checking account to open a money market account, but you do have to make an initial deposit of at least $1,000. I hope this answers your questions, Mr. Lyons. If there's anything else I can help you with, please give me a call. My name's Janelle Archer, and my number is 555-2002. Have a great day."}
