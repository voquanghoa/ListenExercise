First, do you all have your employee handbook? If you need one, go see Ms. Chambers in HR right away. Please read your handbooks, sign the form on the back page, and return those to the HR department by the end of the day Friday. Next, timesheets are to be turned in to your department manager by 5 p.m. each Friday. It's your responsibility to make sure they are filled out properly. If they aren't, your paycheck will be delayed. If you have any expense vouchers or overtime documentation sheets, paper clip - do not staple - them, to the back of your timesheet. Overtime must be pre-approved by your direct supervisor, and you have to get a documentation sheet from the supervisor before working the overtime hours. Pay days are the 15th and 30th of each month, or the closest Friday if one of those dates falls on a weekend. Finally, please note carefully company policy in regard to keeping your work stations clean and projecting a professional appearance in your personal dress."}
