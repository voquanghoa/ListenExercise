Interstate 12 is flowing smoothly again now that cars involved in an earlier accident have been cleared to the shoulder, but volume on State Route 95 is starting to build. Traffic there is backed up near the city center exit due to a stalled vehicle in the right lane, and again north of the city due to a two-car injury accident on the Statesville off ramp. Interstate 1 is bumper-to-bumper on the bridge crossing the river, where work crews are re-paving part of the roadway. All other major routes look good right now, though traffic on Vine Street near the freeway entrance is slowing because of a malfunctioning traffic light. For KOKO, this is Kathy Hendricks with birds-eye traffic."}
