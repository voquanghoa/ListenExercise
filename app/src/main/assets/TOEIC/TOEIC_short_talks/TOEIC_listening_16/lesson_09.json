Sometimes I wonder myself. It's hard work to start a business, any business. So why do I work so hard to start one, get it going, and then walk away to start another one from scratch...? I don't know, really. It's not for the money. If I wanted to get rich I'd make one business enormously successful, then sell it. I guess it's in my DNA. I love the challenge of creating something -- of seeing my dreams spring to life. But once they do, the excitement's gone, and I'm ready for something else. I think the first sign I would be a businessman was when I was nine, and a friend and I started renting our used DVDs to the neighborhood kids. I started my first business at age 13 -- a lawn-mowing service -- and I've been creating companies ever since. Not all of them have been successful, but I think I've learned more from my failures than my successes. This current venture is my 12th start-up company. Five have failed, but six are going strong, so I'm batting better than five-hundred. I'm 60, I'm still in good health, I love what I do -- so I see myself doing this until the day I die."}
