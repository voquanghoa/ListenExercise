These include the water park, the amusement park, baseball games, some mountain resorts, and a few hotels. We will have a complete list posted on our web site by the end of the week. The discounts are up to 40-percent off, and they can be used immediately. To attain the discount rates, employees need to use our company identifier at the time they buy tickets or make reservations. Our identifier is TWA00Z. Please make a note of that, so you can pass it on to your staff for anyone who wants to use it this week. Make sure you tell them that they can use each discount only once a year. In other words, they can't take their family to the water park once in June using the discount, then return in August and get the special rate again. And let's give a big thank-you to the marketing department for securing these great perks!"}
