I need to stay in Pittsburgh a couple extra days to finalize this deal. Could you please cancel my flight tonight and book me on a Friday night flight from Pittsburgh to Cleveland? Then, I'll need a Sunday evening flight from Cleveland home to Chicago. Not too late please. I'll have my wife meet me at the airport, so I won't need a ride. Also, I have a meeting scheduled Monday with Mr. Beckworth from Allen & Allen. Please phone him and reschedule until Tuesday -- no, better make that Wednesday, in case I get delayed in Cleveland. For now, don't forward any messages to me unless they're urgent. I'll be in negotiations all day tomorrow and Friday. If you need to reach me, call my cell phone and leave a message. Thanks Carol. I'll see you Monday morning."}
