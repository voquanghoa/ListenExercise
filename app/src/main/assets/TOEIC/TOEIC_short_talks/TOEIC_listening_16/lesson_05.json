Those are weird words to say, but the time has come for me to step down. I will remain chairman of the board, and am going to concentrate on helping us grow our brand internationally. I'll be handing the reins of CEO over to Quinn Constantine, a man who is not only our executive vice president but someone who has dedicated his entire career to our firm. Quinn came aboard about 20 years ago, fresh out of college, and began as a software engineer. His drive and vision have been instrumental in developing our most popular and successful products. He has spent the past five years working closely with me, and contrary to what some critics are saying, I can assure you that he is well-prepared for this change, and is qualified to keep this company among the leaders in an increasingly competitive high-tech industry. I expect there will be little change in our day-to-day operations, but I'll let your new boss speak for himself. Ladies and gentlemen, here's Quinn Constantine."}
