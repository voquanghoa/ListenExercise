A five-car collision at the intersection of Highway 10 and State Route 20 is backing up traffic on both those roadways. Emergency vehicles are en route to the scene, and it looks like it will be quite awhile until that intersection is cleared. Meanwhile, a stalled vehicle in the right lane is causing hesitation on northbound Interstate Freeway 2 between the Main and First street exits. Southbound Interstate 2, on the other hand, is clear sailing right now, with only a 15-minute commute from downtown to the southern suburbs. There are no other major problems right now, but remember that the lake bridge westbound will be closed from 9 to midnight tonight for pavement repair. Now, back to the baseball game on KPLZ."}
