The economy has been weak, and consequently our profits are down about 25 percent. Like everyone else, we need to tighten our belts, and we've been talking about the best way to do this. One measure we've decided to enact is a temporary hiring freeze. I can assure you that none of you will lose your jobs, but effective immediately, we will not hire new employees for at least the next two financial quarters. I know we're short-handed, and that some of you have been doing the work of two positions. Unfortunately, you will have to continue doing so, and others of you will have to take on new duties to help us through this difficult time. We are not in a position to remunerate you for these sacrifices, but we will note what you are doing, and when things pick up in the future we will try our best to compensate you for them. In addition, we need to cut back on office supplies, and make extra efforts to save costs on electricity. Mr. Thompson will now share a few tips on how to do this. Thank you for your cooperation."}
