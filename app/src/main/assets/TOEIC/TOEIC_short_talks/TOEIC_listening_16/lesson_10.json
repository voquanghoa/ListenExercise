My name's Sandra, and I'll be your guide on this beautiful day. We'll start here at the pier, which seems natural since this city was founded 150 years ago as a major seaport. Next we'll explore the three major hills that surround downtown -- First Hill, Pill Hill, and High Point. These will include stops at the Native American Center, the Art Museum, and a ride to High Point via cable car for a picnic lunch. Then we'll take the Goose on a short cruise around Lake Lincoln, and end with a tour of the downtown historical district. Please keep your hands and feet inside the Goose at all times. If you have any questions, hold them until the end of the tour, when we will have a 15-minute question and answer session. Thank you for joining us today!"}
