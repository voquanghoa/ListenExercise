Well, you can put away your umbrellas for a while and break out the suntan lotion! The rain we've been experiencing the past week will stop this morning, and we're expecting afternoon clearing with partly cloudy skies and highs in the mid- 70s. Looking at the five-day forecast, this high-pressure front moving in from the east this morning will drive out rain clouds, and the rest of the week looks to be sunny and clear, with highs in the low- to mid-70s and lows dipping into the upper 40s. Chance of rain is 40 percent today but drops to 10 percent by Friday. As you can see, there's a low-pressure front headed our way from the north which is expected to reach us by the weekend, and may bring some more clouds and a chance of rain. But for now, get out and enjoy the sunshine!"}
