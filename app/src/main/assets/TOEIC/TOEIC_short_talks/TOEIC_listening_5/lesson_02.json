This is captain Markus DiPolo up here in the cockpit. Our flight to Chicago should take about 6 hours and 15 minutes, with a scheduled 3:30 landing at O'Hare International. We'll be cruising at an altitude of 35,000 feet with a maximum speed of 30,000 knots, and our route will take us north-northeast over the Grand Canyon and Rocky Mountains. The weather en route is clear and calm, so we're anticipating low to no turbulence. Your flight crew will be serving drinks and a snack, followed in an hour or so by a full dinner. After dinner we have a full-length movie. So relax and enjoy yourselves. We do ask that you obey the no-smoking signs, including no smoking in the lavatories. Thank you for flying with us today."}
