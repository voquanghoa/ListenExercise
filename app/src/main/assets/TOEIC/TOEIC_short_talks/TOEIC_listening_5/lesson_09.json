Today I'd like to talk about marketing strategy. The first item on the agenda is results of the polling conducted by A & I Research. Mark will present and interpret those results for us. Second, we'll hear an advertising report from Amanda, who'll give us the numbers from our recent radio and TV campaign. Next, Geoffrey will update us on research trends in the industry, and suggest ways we can use those in marketing our product. Finally, I'd like to have a group brainstorm for 30 minutes or so on marketing ideas and the future direction of marketing for our company. I hope we'll be able to adjourn by 4:30. Before we hear from Mark, let's hear briefly. How are you doing on compiling this year's budget?"}
