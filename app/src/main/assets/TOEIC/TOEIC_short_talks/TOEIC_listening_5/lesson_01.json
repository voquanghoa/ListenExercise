James, I'm a reporter at the Local Business Journal, and I was referred to you by Kareen Christenson of your marketing department. She said that you would be a good person to talk with for my upcoming piece on new downtown development, and I'd like to arrange a time this week that we could meet for an interview. I'll need only about 20 minutes of your time. I want to talk mostly about the Twin Towers building, and also about developments in the works for next year. Could you please call me at 555-737-6233? Again, my name's Wanda Carlson of the Local Business Journal. Thank you. Goodbye."}
