I'm stuck in traffic, and I need you to make a few schedule changes for me. First, I'll need to cancel my nine o'clock meeting with Tom Shafely. See if we can reschedule it for early next week. Then I need you to call my 11 o'clock appointment, Ida Gonzalez, and move it to 11:30. I have lunch with Craig Mora at 12:30 at the Steakhouse, but I won't be able to get there on time, so I'll need to move it to the Creole Cafe? Could you please cancel our reservations at the Steakhouse and make new ones at the Creole? Also, call Craig and tell him I might be a few minutes late. Thank you Marge. Please hold all my calls, and I'll be in at about 11. If my wife calls, tell her I'll phone her back at that time."}
