Our next city council candidate, James Basko, is also the youngest, just 23 years old. Mr. Basko graduated last year from State University with a BS degree in public management and a minor in English. He has lived in the city all his life, and graduated from Lincoln High School. He currently lives in the Redwood neighborhood with his fiancï¿½e. He says he's running for City Council because he thinks city government needs to be more responsive to the needs of young people. Mr. Basko is a Cub Scout leader, volunteers with the Big Brothers program, and is on the city's Youth Advisory Board. Ladies and gentlemen, please welcome James Basko."}
