Welcome to the annual International Business Conference. If you have not yet registered for the conference, go the tables on the left side of the room. Be sure to have picture identification ready. We accept cash and credit cards only, no checks please. If you have pre-registered, go the tables at the back of the room to pick up your conference badge and information packets. You must wear your badge for admittance to all conference sessions. If you have registered and already have your badge and information packet, please proceed to the blue ballroom for the welcoming speech. Go through the doors in the back, and down the hallway to the right. If you have any questions or need special assistance, there is an information booth in the back corner of the room. Look for the blue sign. It's our pleasure to have you here, and we hope you enjoy the conference."}
