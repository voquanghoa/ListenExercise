The commute is pretty much a mess everywhere at this hour. Highway 22 is crawling from downtown to the North Street exit. Interstate 7 is a logjam between Hillville to the county line, and State Route 10 is heavy from the city heading east into Bell Acres. We're getting a report of a two-car collision on Highway 12 just south of Kinnear Street that's blocking the left two lanes there. The only route that looks pretty good right now is Interstate 306, which is bottle-necked at the convention center but clears west of there and then is off and on into Rockway. This report is brought to you by Koala Cola, the drink that is refreshingly different. This has been Patricia Prentice for WRAP-FM. Our next Koala Cola update will be at the top of the hour."}
