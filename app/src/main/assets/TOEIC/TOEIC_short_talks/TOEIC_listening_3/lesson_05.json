Welcome to the Richmond Real Estate training course. My name's Wendy Pozinka, and I'm a licensed real estate agent and personnel director for Richmond. At the end of our six-week course all of you, hopefully, will be able to pass the real estate exam and become Richmond agents. Here are some things to note before we begin our training. First, you need to hand in your blue class registration forms at the table in the front of the room. Then, go the table against the right wall to find your name tag and a packet of course information. Next, go the table in the back corner to pick up your text book. Once you have done all these things, find a seat and sit down. When everyone's ready Nathan Richmond, our company president, will say a few remarks. After that, we'll head for the conference room and tonight's first class. Okay? Are there any questions?"}
