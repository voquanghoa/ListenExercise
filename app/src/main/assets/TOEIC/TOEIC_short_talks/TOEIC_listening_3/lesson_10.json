This is Miguel Lopez with WOMB \"Eagle Eye\" traffic. Rush hour is in full swing all over the valley, and volumes are heavy on all major thoroughfares. Traffic is gridlocked on Interstate 11 from Maple Street clear to Valley Market Center, where it finally begins to thin out. Interstate 305 isn't much better; pretty much bumper-to-bumper through the six-mile stretch from Belleville to Redland. The only blocking slowdown at this hour is on State Route 10, where a car in the left lane has apparently run out of gas near the Mountain View exit. There is a tow truck on the way to the scene to help out, and we can see some people trying to push the car onto the left shoulder. The only other major bottleneck at this hour is on Westmont Avenue, where the right lane is closed for a couple of miles due to ongoing road improvements. It's better to take Eastlake Way instead. I'm Miguel Lopez for \"Eagle Eye\" traffic. Now back to you in the studio, Dave."}
