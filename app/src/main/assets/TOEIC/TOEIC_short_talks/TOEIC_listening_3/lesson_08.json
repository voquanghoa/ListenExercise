Ms. Johannsen had inquired about our advertising rates. In a nutshell, they depend on the size of the advertisement, volume and frequency. Our basic rates range from $20 for a one-column-by-one-inch ad to $5,000 for a full-page color ad. We offer volume discounts for multiple ads, as well as discounts for ads that run more than twice in one week or four times in a month. We have a fantastic ad-design department, and we also accept camera-ready ads, which should be submitted at least one day before publication. OK, I hope this answers your general questions. If you want more specific details, please call me back at 555-0904, ext. 654, or e-mail me at Van Hoffman - that's V-A-N H-O-double F- M-A-N dot g at Times-News dot com, and I'll be happy to give you more information. Have a good day now!"}
