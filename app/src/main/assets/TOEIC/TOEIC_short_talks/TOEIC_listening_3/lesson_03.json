I got your message asking about changing our meeting time on Thursday from 5 o'clock to 3, and I'm afraid that time won't work for me. I'm tied up in a tele-conference that day until 4. Would 4 o'clock work for you? If not, I'm available Friday morning at 8 and 11, and in the afternoon at either 2 or 3:30. Otherwise, we'll have to aim for next week sometime. Monday and Wednesday afternoons work best for me, but I also have a couple of morning openings on Tuesday and Friday. Why don't you call me and let me know what works best for you? My office number is 555-3084, extension 111. If I'm not in, you can set an appointment with my secretary, Lori Crowther. Or, you could try my cell at 555-3169. If you need to e-mail me, it's dellstad at frugal.net. I'm looking forward to meeting with you, Mr. Billups. Good bye."}
