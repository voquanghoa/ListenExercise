She has been involved in local politics for longer than I've been alive, and over the past four decades has become an icon of our city and community. She started by serving eight years on the city council, and then eight years as mayor. After that, she was elected for two terms as our state governor, then two more terms as state representative. As if that weren't enough, she has been president of her children's Parent-Teacher Association three separate times, and now is the volunteer president of our local chapter of Citizens for a Greener America. She has a PhD in public policy from State University, where she serves on the advisory board, and last month received an honorary degree from Harvard. Ladies and gentlemen, please join me in giving a warm welcome to a very special guest: Ms. Lindsey Larson! (loud clapping, cheering)"}
