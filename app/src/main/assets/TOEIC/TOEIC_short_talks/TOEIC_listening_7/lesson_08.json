Whatever happened under the previous regime will not affect how you're treated by me and members of this staff. You are in good standing with us until you give us reason not to be. The second thing is you have to believe that you can win. I know that you didn't win many games the past four years. I don't know why. We can't be satisfied with that. But I've looked at tape, and I DO know that you have the talent to win. You need to believe that. I repeat: You are talented enough to succeed! I want you to think about something my high school coach told me. He said, \"Whether you think you can, or whether you think you can't, you're right.\" The choice is up to you."}
