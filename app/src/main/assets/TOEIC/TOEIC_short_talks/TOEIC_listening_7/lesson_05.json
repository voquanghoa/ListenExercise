I was unable to book a flight on the 30th, so I booked a flight at 8:30 a.m. the 31st with Arizona Air. You'll need to be at the airport two hours before departure, and your tickets will be waiting at the check-in counter. When the plane lands in Arizona Springs, Mr. Tim Lazarro will meet you at the gate and drive you to the Desert Oasis hotel. Look for a man holding a sign with your name on it. You're booked into the Desert Oasis for four nights, with a return flight scheduled for 3 p.m. on the Fourth. If you have any questions, Mr. Pierce, please give me a call at 559-3447. Again, my name's Sheila Lancaster, and thank you for choosing Terrific Travel."}
