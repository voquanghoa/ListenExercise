A car-bus collision in the southbound lanes has brought Interstate 35 to a virtual shutdown in both directions near Northcenter. There appear to be numerous injuries, and the state patrol and aid cars are on the scene. Three lanes are closed southbound, and northbound traffic on I-35 is crawling through the area as people slow to take a peek. Other area roadways appear normal for this hour. Highway 4 is smooth sailing through downtown, and State Route 20 has off-and-on slowing from Wideview through Treeland. If you're crossing the river the Sky Street bridge is your best bet, as the Key Bridge is still slow due to the effects of an earlier debris spill in the left eastbound lane. For WYFF-FM, this is Marcy Maradona. We'll be back with more news after this word from our sponsor."}
