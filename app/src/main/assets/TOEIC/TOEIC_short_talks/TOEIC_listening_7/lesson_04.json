My name is Lenny DiCardio, and it's my great pleasure and honor to introduce our keynote speaker this evening. He arrived this morning from India, where he is currently filming his new movie,b \"Asian Dream,\" scheduled for release early next year. I have known Miguel Soriano for more than 20 years, and I think of him first not as a famous director but as a citizen, father, teacher, and friend. Yes, it's true that he has directed some of the greatest motion pictures of our time, and that he has made famous actors such as Roberto DiNardo and Martin Braun. But it's also true that he has raised five fine children, volunteered for his local church, and given millions of dollars to charities such as this one. Ladies and gentlemen, please give it up for Mr. Miguel Soriano! (loud clapping and cheering)."}
