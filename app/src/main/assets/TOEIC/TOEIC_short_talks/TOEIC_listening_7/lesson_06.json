This is Vice Principal Tom Tebow with a special announcement. Due to icy road conditions, all after-school programs today have been cancelled. If you are in one of these programs and normally ride the special-activity bus, listen carefully. The special-activity bus will leave today directly after the final bell rings, and it will load in the east parking lot. Regular buses will leave as usual from the west parking lot. If you are being picked up by a parent today instead of riding the bus, your parent must come to the main office first and sign you out. Please do not leave school with your parent unless you were signed out at the office. All buses will be on snow routes this afternoon. They will drop you at your snow bus stop. Again, the special-activity bus leaves directly after school from the east parking lot, and all buses will be on snow routes. Thank you."}
