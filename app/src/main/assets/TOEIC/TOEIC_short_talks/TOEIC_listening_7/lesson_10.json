Accounting had a couple of questions about your expense vouchers. They're missing a few receipts from your trip to Boston, and they need an additional copy of your airline ticket stub from your trip to Phoenix last month. When you get back from lunch, could you please call Steve Probinski in accounting. His extension is 991. Thanks. Also, I'm going to need the Boston report by 5 p.m. tomorrow. If you have any questions or problems with it, let me know. I'm going out to lunch now, then I'll be tied up in a board meeting 'til about 4, but I have some time after that if you need to get together. OK, Tom, talk with your later."}
