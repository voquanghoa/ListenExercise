What better time than Valentine's Day to express your love with a diamond ring or necklace? And what better place to purchase your special gift than Jonathan's Jewelry? I'm Jonathan James, owner of Jonathan's Jewelry, here to tell you that we have the widest selection of diamonds in the state. No matter what your budget, we can find something that you can afford, and that she will love.

We're your friend in the diamond business, with three convenient locations: on Enormous Mall Parkway, Northeastgate Village, and downtown on First and Main. Come on in and see us today!"}
