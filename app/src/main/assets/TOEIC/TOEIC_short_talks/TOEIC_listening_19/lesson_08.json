I have been named the lead architect. We understand that serious problems have led to the current situation at the museum. The museum building is 100 years old. It has not been properly taken care of, and it needs a lot of work. Everything from the foundation to the heating system will have to be restored and repaired. It will be expensive, but the work must be done if the museum is to last another hundred years. Now I am going to describe all of the problems in detail. Then I'll explain the work that needs to be done and how we will do it."}
