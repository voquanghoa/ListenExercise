This is Marianne McCrossen from D.E.B. Corporation. I wanted to let you know that we were all impressed by your presentation earlier this week. We'd like you to give us a quote on the project. So I've gone ahead and e-mailed a formal request for a bid to you. We'll need to receive the information by November 14 at the latest. Please note that we will not be able to accept anything submitted after that date. It would be great if you could get it to us sooner. If you have any questions about the specifications, call me at 555-4767. We look forward to receiving your bid."}
