First, I'd like to tell you a little bit about myself and then I'll move on to the demonstration. My name is Deidra Parsons, and I've been a professional chef with the Household Gourmet for five years now. In this role, I've been able to work doing two things I love -- cooking and meeting new people. The Household Gourmet was founded thirty years ago to provide people with kitchen products that reduce both cooking and clean-up time. Tonight I'll be preparing two easy, delicious treats for you. The first is an appetizer that can be made very quickly using several prepared items from the supermarket. The second treat is a dessert that takes a little bit longer to make, but is well worth the trouble. As I prepare these dishes, I'll be demonstrating some of our efficient, effective, inexpensive kitchen products for you. And at the end of the demonstration, we'll all be able to sample the results; then I'll help you place your orders for Household Gourmet products."}
