My name is Wendy Cho, and I will be spending about 30 minutes introducing you to the schedule for this week's training. At 10:30 we will take a brief break, and then Karen Maitland from the personnel and benefits office will go over the forms in your packet and answer any questions you may have about company policies. Karen has been with the company since it was started and has lots of information to share with you. Lunch will be provided from 12:00 noon to one o'clock. In the afternoon, we'll start with an excellent video about the history of Jasson Industries. Following the video, at 3:30, we will break up into groups by the department you' II be working in, and you will meet your group trainers. Your technical training will begin tomorrow. Your trainers will explain where and when to meet and give you any materials you will need to get started."}
