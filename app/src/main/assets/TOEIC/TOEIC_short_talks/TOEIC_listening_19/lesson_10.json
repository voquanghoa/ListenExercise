Multi-tasking, or doing two or more things at the same time, is now a common theme in the workplace. So, why not try and combine your daily commute with a good aerobic workout? Cycling is a great way of doing just that, and you can get to work just as quickly as you can by car for most journeys under five miles. And you don't have to pay for parking. As part of National Bike Week, our cycle forum is holding a bike riders' breakfast on Thursday, July sixteenth in front of the Collins Building. If you can show that you arrived at work by bike, there will be free coffee, orange juice, fruit, and yogurt awaiting you!"}
