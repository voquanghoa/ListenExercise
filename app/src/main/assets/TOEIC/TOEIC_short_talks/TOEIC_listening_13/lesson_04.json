It happened almost by accident, actually. I've always liked to write. When I was in college, I had a couple of short stories published in the campus literature magazine. But I majored in business. When I was 28, I wrote a short story in my spare time. My wife read it, and submitted it to a magazine behind my back. Well, it was published. That encouraged me to start writing more in my spare time. By age 32, I had completed my first novel. To my great surprise, it became a best-seller. So I quit my business job and began writing full time. Now, after six best-sellers, I finally consider myself to be a writer."}
