When you come in, the first thing to do is find your time card. Time cards are in this rack on the wall, next to the clock. They're filed in alphabetical order. Punch in by inserting your card in the slot on top of the clock. This will stamp onto the card the time that you start work. Then return your card to its place on the rack. When you go to lunch, make sure that you take your time card again and punch out when you leave, and punch in when you get back. Also be sure and punch out at the end of the day."}
