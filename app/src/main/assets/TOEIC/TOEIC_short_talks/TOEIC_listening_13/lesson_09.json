Even though these classes are free to our employees, some of you have complained that workers in your department aren't taking advantage of them. Staff have complained that they are too tired and too busy to drive to the IBD campus after work. But I have a hunch that most of them don't recognize the benefit expanded computer skills will have for their job performance. I can understand this, since most of them already have the skill they need to perform their current jobs well. So, I propose that we hire a presenter, Jim Jefferson, to give our staff a motivational lecture about why continued learning is important in their careers."}
