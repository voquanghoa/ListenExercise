This is Robin. Could you please tell Rico and Yumi that I'm going to be a few minutes late for our appointment? My friend was supposed to pick me up from the airport, but her car had a flat tire on the way. I just called her, and she's gotten it fixed but is stuck in traffic downtown, so she won't be here for about 20 more minutes. It's 11 now, and our appointment is at 11:30, so there's no way I'm going to make it on time. Please tell them I hope to be there by noon. While you're waiting for me, you could start by briefing them on our company. Thanks."}
