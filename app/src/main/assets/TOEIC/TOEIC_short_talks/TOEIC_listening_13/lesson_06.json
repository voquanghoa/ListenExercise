Then come to Wild Water Park. We have something for everyone in the family. Toddlers will love our splash-and-squirt pool. Older boys and girls can surf with bodies or boogie board in our giant wave pool. And we have water slides suited for all ages, including our famous \"Howlin' Hurricane\" and \"Daredevil Drop\" -- slides bigger and better than any you'll find at other water parks. Wild Water Park opens for the summer on Friday, June 21st. Right now, we're offering family passes to opening weekend for only $50 -- that's $25 less than the usual price. And, if you buy your family pass before June 14th, you'll get a children's ticket for any other date during the summer absolutely free. Don't wait!
