For your safety and the safety of those around you, we ask that you observe the following regulations. First, you must remain in the vehicles at all times. Second, do not feed any of the animals as you drive past them. Third, take pictures only when instructed to do so by your guide. Finally, turn off all noise-making devices such as cell phones and MP3 players while touring the park. Anyone violating these rules will have their park admission revoked, without refund. In addition, they could be subject to arrest and a fine up to $5,000. Please enjoy your tour today through Wildlife Park. Thank you."}
