It's taken 18 months to complete this building, but I think the wait has been worth it. This magnificent ceiling-glass structure has been called the perfect marriage of function and form, and I think all of us here today would agree with that statement. Now I'm going to hand the microphone to a special guest, the man who designed this beautiful edifice, Klaus Kirshner. Mr. Kirshner has flown all the way from Austria for this occasion, and we are honored to have him with us. He is renowned throughout the world for his innovative architecture and distinctive style. Would you please join me in giving a warm Holmstead welcome to Klaus Kirshner!"}
