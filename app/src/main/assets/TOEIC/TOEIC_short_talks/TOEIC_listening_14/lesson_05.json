It's hard for me to predict how long I'll keep playing, but I'd like to keep going as long as I'm healthy and can help my team win. I'm 35 now, and I feel great. The knee injury I suffered last year is completely healed. It feels like I could play for four or five more years. Of course, once the season starts, that could change. Maybe my knee will get hurt again, or else another part of my body. I don't want to be out there playing if I'm not able to compete at a high level. They're paying me five million dollars a year, and I want to prove that I'm worth it. If I ever reach the point where I feel like I'm not giving the fans their money's worth, then I'll be glad to retire and let a younger player take over. I've been playing this game since I was seven years old, and professionally since I was 21, I'm thankful that I've lasted this long and done as well as I have. It's already been a great career."}
