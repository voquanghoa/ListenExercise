All public elementary, middle and high schools will begin two hours late. Because of ice on the roads, buses will pick up children at their special snow-stop locations, instead of the regular bus stops. If you do not know where your child's snow bus stop is, call the district transportation office at 555-3343. Schools will end at the regular time, but all after-school activities today have been cancelled. Buses will deliver students to their snow-stop locations.
