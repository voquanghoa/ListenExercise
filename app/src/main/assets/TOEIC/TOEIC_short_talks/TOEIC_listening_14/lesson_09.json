This message is for Christian Collier. I'm not sure if this is the right number. My name is Wendy Moss, and I found your wallet yesterday in Center Park. Don't worry, it doesn't seem like anything is missing. It has some cash, your driver's license, and credit cards. I found your phone number on a medical identification card. I hope the number is still current. Anyway, if you could call me, we can arrange to meet and you can pick up your wallet. I live only a couple of miles from you, if the address on your driver's license is correct. So, again, my name is Wendy, and my phone number is 555-8629. I'm going to a movie tonight, but I'll check my voice mail when it's over and if you leave a message I'll call you back. Bye."}
