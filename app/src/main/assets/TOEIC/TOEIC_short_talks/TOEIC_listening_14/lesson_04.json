As you know, this is a huge part of our business. Ads account for about 60 percent of all our annual revenue. Last year, our advertising revenue grew by 3 percent. This year, our goal is to double that figure, to 6 percent. How can we do that? We've discussed running an auction for on-line advertisements. The highest bidder will get to put their ad at the top of our web page. The winner of the auction will be the company that is willing to pay the most money per click. That means that each time someone clicks on their ad, they pay us. But they have to tell us, in advance, how much they are willing to pay. I think this is a good idea, but we have identified some software problems that have to be worked out so that we can set up an auction system. Let's put Jamie and Chris to work on those problems. We'll talk about this again in two weeks."}
