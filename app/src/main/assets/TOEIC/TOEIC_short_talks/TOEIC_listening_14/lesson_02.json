My name is Mindy, and I'll be your guide today. We're going to start by visiting a sheep farm, so you can see the wool that this area is famous for. We'll watch a sheep dog perform a round up, then see a farmer shear off the sheep's wool. Next we'll visit a plant that makes apple juice, another famous local product. You'll get a chance to help pick apples, and also a carton of fresh juice to enjoy. We'll end our day by visiting our most well-known attraction, the oyster-shell opera house. While there, we'll watch a rehearsal for an upcoming performance."}
