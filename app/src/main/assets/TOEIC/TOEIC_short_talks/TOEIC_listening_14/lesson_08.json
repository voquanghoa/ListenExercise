Like the middle of a crowded freeway. Or a deserted road late at night. But now a flat tire doesn't have to ruin your trip. Due to revolutionary new technology, Ruble Tires let you drive up to 100 miles after a flat, so you can change the tire in a safe, comfortable environment. Ruble's new Rugged Wear tires are side reinforced, so the rubber on the side of the tire supports a car's weight even when the bottom of the tire loses air. Rugged Wear tires are the latest in a long line of Ruble innovations. At Ruble, we make driving safer. For more information on all Ruble Tires, visit our website at www.ruble.com."}
