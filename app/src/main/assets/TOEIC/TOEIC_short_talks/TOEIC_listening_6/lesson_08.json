All major roadways are flowing pretty smoothly at this hour. Interstate 99 is a little slow from downtown to North Lake because of an earlier stalled vehicle, which has now been cleared to the shoulder, and State Route 420 is a little bit heavy near the Stadium exit due to some construction work on the off ramp. But otherwise things look better than usual for your afternoon commute. We're just getting word of an overturned semi on the Valley highway near Mayberry, so we'll give you more details on that next hour. Traffic is brought to you this hour by Body Works, the place that works wonders for your body. This has been Tracy Thompson reporting for WHIP 91.7 FM."}
