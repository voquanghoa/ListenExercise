The tall white building behind that is the Ricks Tower, which was the tallest building in the city for almost 100 years. Coming up on the left-hand side is the oldest building in town. Constructed in 1835, it was originally the county courthouse. It's gone through several reincarnations since then, and is currently the Pit Stop, one of the city's finest watering holes. Ahead on the right is the Gazette Building, home of the city's largest newspaper. OK, now we're leaving downtown and headed for the University District, to check out some historic architecture at the state's most prestigious institute of higher education. After that, we'll have lunch at 12 o'clock at the historic Rose Inn, prior to our afternoon cruise on the lake."}
