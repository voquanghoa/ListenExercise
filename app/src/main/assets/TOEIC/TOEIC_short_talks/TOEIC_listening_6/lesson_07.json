We interviewed six candidates, and chose MaryAnn because of her experience and enthusiasm. She knows basketball well, not only because she was a college player herself, at Western University, but she also comes from a basketball family. Her father, Jerry, was a long-time high school coach, and her mother, Brenda, has coached youth basketball for more than 20 years. Her two sisters, Linda and Abigail, also played hoops in high school and college. After a brief pro career, MaryAnn returned to Western as an assistant coach for two years, and then moved up as an assistant at Tech University for four years. She got her first head coaching job at Valley State, which she led to the league championship before moving to Hickstown U, where she's gone 64-18 and won two league titles the past three seasons. So, without further ado, I'll turn the microphone over to MaryAnn to answer your questions."}
