This is a special announcement from Mr. Brighton's office. Due to the snowstorm, several employees have had trouble getting to work. So we have adjusted today's deadline schedule as follows: The deadline for advertising copy has been pushed back from 10 o'clock to noon. The deadline for editorial copy has been moved from 2 o'clock to 5. The deadline for all advertising artwork - photos and drawings - will be 3 o'clock instead of 11. Finally, the deadline for all editorial artwork - photos, charts, and graphics - will be 4 o'clock instead of 1. Thank you for your cooperation in this matter. If you think you will still need a deadline extension, please talk to your department manager. On behalf of Mr. Brighton and all the senior executives, we appreciate your efforts during this terrible weather."}
