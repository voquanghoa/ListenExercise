During the holidays, it's OK to celebrate with a little bit of good cheer. But it's not OK to get behind the wheel of a car after you've been drinking. With winter weather already making driving tough, don't make it any harder on yourself - or others - by trying to drive while you're intoxicated. If you plan to drink, arrange a designated driver before the party begins. If you notice someone who shouldn't be driving, talk them into giving you their keys. If they refuse, call 911. Remember, friends don't let friends drive drunk. Finally, if you do happen to find yourself too drunk to drive, call 555-TAXI for a special, free holiday lift. That's 555-TAXI for a free ride anywhere in the county. The state patrol wishes everyone a happy, and safe, holiday season."}
