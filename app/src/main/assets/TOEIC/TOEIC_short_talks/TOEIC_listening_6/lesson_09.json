Harry, Mayor Nicolas is out of town until Monday, so he won't be available for an interview until next week. He has a city council meeting on Monday, and is hosting the city marketing convention Tuesday, so sometime Wednesday might be the best time for him to talk to you. I don't know when the deadline is for your story. Would Wednesday work for you? If you need some background information, you can call me at 555-0066. Otherwise, let us know what time on Wednesday works best for you. You could phone my assistant, Sheila Shepherd, at 55-0067 and let her know. Then I'll get back to you and we can finalize arrangements. Thank you Harry. Talk to you soon."}
