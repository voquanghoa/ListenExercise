The Senate will vote today on a bill to bail out the nation's farmers. The bill passed the House of Representatives last week in a very close vote. The president has said he will sign the bill if it passed. Locally, work crews are still cleaning up debris from last week's flooding in the eastern part of the state. The governor has declared the flood spots a disaster area, and asked the federal government for financial help. In sports, State and Tech universities are preparing for tomorrow's annual showdown to see who takes home the Silver Cup. Kickoff is at noon, and you can hear the game right here on KRKR 550 AM. I'm Mike Mannequin in the news center. Stay tuned for traffic and weather after this word from our sponsor."}
