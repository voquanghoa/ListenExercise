My name is Darcy McGuire, and I'm calling to inquire about your cleaning services. I was referred to you by my neighbor, Doris Magnusson, who says you've been cleaning her home for a couple of years. I own a four-bedroom house in Green Haven, and I'd like to have someone come and clean it twice a month. Could you please tell me how much that would cost? Do you send just one person, or a team of two? Also, what type of cleaning materials do you use? Are they environmentally friendly? Do I need to provide anything? Oh, one more thing. Do you charge extra for pets? I have a dog and two cats. Again, my name's Darcy McGuire, and if you could please call me at 555-6996, I'd appreciate it. You could talk to me or my daughter, Daisy Meyers, who lives downstairs. I'd like to get started next week, so I hope to hear from you soon. Thank you."}
