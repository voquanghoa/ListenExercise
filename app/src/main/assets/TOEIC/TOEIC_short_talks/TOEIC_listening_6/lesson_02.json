The bottom drawer locks, so you'll want to put any valuables in there, and make sure you keep your key! Now over here is the break room. There are two vending machines, as well as the coffee maker there. Extra filters and bags are in the cupboards above. There are also bowls, and silverware in the drawers next to the microwave. Everyone is responsible for cleaning their own dishes, thank you. OK, the bathrooms are down the hall on the right. The conference room is opposite the restrooms, and the manager's office is around the corner from the conference room... the door at the end of the hall. The employees' lunch room is on the second floor, and the gym/relaxation center is on the fourth floor. That just about does it, I guess. Do you have any questions?"}
