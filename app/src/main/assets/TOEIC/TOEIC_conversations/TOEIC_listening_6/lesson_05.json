Where are you off to so early on a Saturday?\n� There's a huge sale today at CostLess. Most items are at least 50 percent off. The store doesn't open until 9, but I need to get in line.\n� Well, you'd better bring a book or a laptop with you; it's going to be a long wait. Those CostLess sales are always crazy. Good luck fighting the mob!\n� Oh I don't mind. I have some knitting to keep me busy, and it's worth it to get half off a new TV. Have a good day!"}
