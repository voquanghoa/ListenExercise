Anyone have ideas how to bring them up?\n� I think we need to promote more heavily. Our new X-3PO is a great product. Once more people know about it, sales will soar. This will create demand for our other products.\n� So, are you saying we should spend more money on advertising?\n� Not necessarily. But we should try different advertisements designed to get the X-3PO in customers' hands. Like 2-for-1 deals, and free downloads on new X-3POs."}
