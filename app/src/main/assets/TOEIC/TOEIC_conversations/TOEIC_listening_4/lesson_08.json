How's your new building coming along?\n� Pretty well. I'm waiting for the painters to finish so I can install carpets. They still have three more apartments to paint. I'm hoping they'll finish soon, because I have the units rented, but I can't let tenants move in until the carpets are down.\n� Have you rented all eight of the apartments?\n� No, not yet. I have six of them rented, and I'm advertising for the last two in the Post-News."}
