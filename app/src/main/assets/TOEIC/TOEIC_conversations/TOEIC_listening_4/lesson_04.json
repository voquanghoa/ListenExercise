How's your research going for the board of directors' report? Is there anything I can help you with?\n� Thank for offering, Liv. I've been summarizing customer satisfaction surveys for each quarter of last year. It's pretty interesting. Actually, if it's not too much trouble, would you proofreading my power-point slides? I'll have them finished in about an hour.\n� Sure, no problem. E-mail them to me and I'll look them over. Did you discover anything interesting in reading the surveys?\n� Oh yes. They're quite interesting. Probably the most fascinating thing were the opinions about the price of our product. In the first quarter, about 70 percent of the customers said it was priced fairly, but by the last quarter, when the economy had worsened, more than 80 percent said it was priced too high."}
