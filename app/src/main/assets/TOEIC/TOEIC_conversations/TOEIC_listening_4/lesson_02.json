First, you need to fill out a travel voucher, that's the blue form here. Take that to your manager, and get his or her signature on the bottom line. Then, take a copy of that form -- that's the yellow page underneath -- and turn it into accounting. Be sure to attach copies of all your receipts. You keep the third page, the pink form, along with all your original receipts. Reimbursement checks are cut once a month, and they are separate from your normal paycheck. They usually go out on the 15th.\n� OK, blue form to manager, yellow to accounting. I think I've got it. What type of expenses will the company reimburse?\n� Typically taxi, subway and bus fares; admission fees; meals and drinks up to $30 a day; and any necessary business supplies -- either for use on your trip or after you return. Of course, we'll also reimburse for unexpected costs, such as having to rent a hotel room if your flight is cancelled or delayed, or expenses associated with a lost wallet or natural disaster."}
