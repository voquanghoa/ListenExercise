I'm trying to book a venue for our annual conference, and I need your input.\n� Sure, Tanya. What are the choices?\n� Well, we could use the convention center, which is very nice, but also quite expensive. The exhibition hall has a lower price, and it's more convenient, but its facilities are not as nice.\n� Hmm. Why don't you call the convention center and see if they'll come down? If they do, go with them, and if they don't, go with the exhibition hall.\n� That's a good idea. Thank you, Paul. Well, I'd better get right on it. I have to decide by Friday."}
