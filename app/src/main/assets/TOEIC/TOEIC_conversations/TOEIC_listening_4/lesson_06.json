I need to plug-in my laptop computer. Would you mind if I used the outlet by your chair?\n� Not at all, but I'm afraid it doesn't work. I tried it earlier.\n� Oh, that's a problem. I guess we can't always count on the outlets. After all, this is a coffee shop, not an office. But it seems all the other outlets are being used.\n� Why don't you ask at the counter? Maybe they have an extension cord, so you could plug into an outlet down the hall near the restrooms."}
