I'm not sure what to order.\n� Have anything you like. It's on the company. Personally, I recommend the lobster. It's fresh from Maine -- the best in town. But the steaks are also quite good. They use only grass-fed Angus cows. And for dessert, you've got to try the New York Cheesecake!\n� Well thank you. That all sounds delicious. I think I'll have the lobster and a bowl of clam chowder. How about you?\n� I'm going to try a T-bone steak and a Caesar salad. Now, what type of wine do you fancy?"}
