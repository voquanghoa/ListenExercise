This is Dennis Chaix from Castro's Catering. I'm sorry, but there's a slight problem with your catering menu for the party Saturday night, and I wanted to ask you how best to handle it. You wanted 20 pounds of fresh caviar, but our supplier is hampered by a labor dispute, so they can deliver only 10 pounds of caviar. We could refund your money for the other 10 pounds, or substitute something else.\n� Oh dear. Hmmm... well, we have more than 200 guests, so it's probably best to substitute at this point. What would you recommend?\n� Well, you wanted five pounds of smoked sardines. How about 10 more pounds of those?\n� No, let's do this. Five more pounds of sardines, and double the amount of avocado dip, from three bowls to six. Hey, while you're on the phone, can we double-check the order?"}
