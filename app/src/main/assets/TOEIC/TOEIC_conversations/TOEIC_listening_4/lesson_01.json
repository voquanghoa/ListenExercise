One minute please. I can book you on Worldwide Airways, leaving at 9 a.m. the 18th, with a two-hour layover in Seoul, and returning at 2 p.m. the 29th, with a one-hour layover in Tokyo.\n� I'd prefer a direct flight. Also, I'd like to depart in the morning both days, if at all possible.\n� Let me see. I could book a direct flight at 7 a.m. the 29th on Asia Air, and the return flight from Beijing would be late morning -- 11 a.m. -- on the 29th. Would that be all right?"}
