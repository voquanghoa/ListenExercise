Good to see you! I brought a fruit salad. \n� Thanks, Jim. That was very thoughtful. Did you make it yourself?\n� Yeah, but it's nothing fancy. I didn't have time. I just cut up some melon, banana, and grapes and threw them together into a bowl.\n� No need to apologize. I'm sure the guests will love it. It will be a great side dish for the steak I'm grilling. Why don't you put it on the table next to the salads and chips."}
