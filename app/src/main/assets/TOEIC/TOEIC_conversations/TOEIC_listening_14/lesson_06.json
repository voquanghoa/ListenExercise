I've been phoning her and sending e-mails for the past hour. She's not at her desk.\n� She had to go to the downtown office to clear up a problem. Apparently, they sent us the wrong invoices. \n� Well, I have some good news. We have a new advertising client, and I want Tanya to be in charge of their account. \n� That's great news! You should call her on her cell phone. I'm sure she'd rather hear the news from you than read it in an e-mail."}
