Are you coming to our staff meeting this morning? It's at 9 o'clock.\n� Oh! I thought the meeting had been cancelled because so many team members are on vacation this week.\n� Well, I decided to hold the meeting anyway, since I'm going to be away myself for the next three weeks.\n� I see. Well, I'm expecting a phone call from a client at 9 o'clock, so I'll be there at about 9:20."}
