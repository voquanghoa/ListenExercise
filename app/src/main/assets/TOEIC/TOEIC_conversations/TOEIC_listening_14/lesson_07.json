Heating your home with natural gas is so expensive!\n� Yes, my bill is expensive too. I guess that's because the weather's turning colder, so I've been turning up the thermostat lately.\n� So have I. But I still don't think my bill should be this high. Maybe I should call the\ngas company and ask if the rates have gone up.\n� Yeah, that's a good idea. I've called them before, and they have good customer phone service. Let me know what you find out."}
