Simon.\n� Well, this was a good quarter for us. As you can see -- if I can just get this slide to work, ah there it is -- our revenues exceeded expenditures by about $10,000. Much of that was due to holiday sales. As this chart shows, this holiday season was about 10 percent better than last year's.\n� That's certainly good news. So how do we stand overall?\n� Well, despite this quarter we're still in the red, but we've closed the gap considerably. Here's what it looks like. We have $100,000 in credits against $120,000 in debits."}
