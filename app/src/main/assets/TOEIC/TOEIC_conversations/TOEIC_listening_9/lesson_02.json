I bought this clock radio here, but the alarm doesn't work. I need to get it fixed. Here's the receipt.\n� We can fix it for you. Hmm, looks like the timing button is stuck. That'll run about $15.\n� Fifteen dollars?! But I thought you said you'd fix it for free.\n� We do while it's under warranty. But this warranty was for 14 days. I'm afraid it's run out."}
