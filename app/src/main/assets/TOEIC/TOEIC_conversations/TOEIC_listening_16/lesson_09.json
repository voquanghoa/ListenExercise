Do we enough participants for the research panel yet?\n� No, we need three more. We're looking through our data base and phoning people who meet the criteria. But so far either they don't qualify or aren't available to participate for two hours. We need one low-income woman, one middle-class business man, and one high-income home owner of either gender.\n� How about posting an online advertisement? That usually attracts lots of responses.\n� Yes. If we haven't found three more participants by noon, I'll do that. We should have the panel filled by this evening."}
