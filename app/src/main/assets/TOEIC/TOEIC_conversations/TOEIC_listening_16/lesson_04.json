I haven't seen you in awhile. How's your business doing?\n� Hey Mandy. It's doing well, but it's tougher than I thought being self-employed. I have to record all my expenses, and do my own sales and marketing. How are things going at the office? I heard Richard got promoted to marketing director.\n� Yeah, and he's doing a great job. Otherwise things are pretty much the same. We miss you; you should come by for lunch sometime.\n� That's a good idea! I'm pretty busy, but I'll try to drop in sometime next week."}
