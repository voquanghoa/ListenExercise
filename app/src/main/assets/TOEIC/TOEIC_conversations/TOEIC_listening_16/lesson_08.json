Didn't you see the memo last week? We are using Office Essentials now instead of Office Place.\n� Really? No, I didn't see the memo. I was in Miami, and when I got back on Monday I was swamped with work. It must be on my desk somewhere.\n� OK. Is it too late to cancel the order with Office Place? If so, great. If not, I'll explain the situation to accounting.\n� Thanks, Darlene. I'll check it out."}
