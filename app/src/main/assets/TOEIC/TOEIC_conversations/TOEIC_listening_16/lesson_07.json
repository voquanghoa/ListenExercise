Mr. Evans asked me to help Rebecca with a rush order yesterday, so I'm behind on my presentation.\n� Uh oh. I'll see if I can reschedule for Monday. Would that give you enough time to finish?\n� Yes it would. I'll work all day Friday on it, then over the weekend if I need to. Don't worry, I'll be ready by Monday. Thanks."}
