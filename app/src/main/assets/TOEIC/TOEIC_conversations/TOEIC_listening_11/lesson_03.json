This is great; it's about time!\n� It sure is! When the system crashed last Friday, it was the last straw. That's when Mr. Thompson gave me the green light to order new computers. I'm aiming to get a new system installed by the end of the month, but I still have some research to do because I want to change vendors.\n� It'd be a good idea to use a vendor that offers ongoing technical support. I know that Ingram Computers has an excellent reputation for customer service, and they have a comprehensive parts replacement warranty. During the warranty period, if something goes wrong they'll replace your computer outright or else lend you a computer while they repair yours.\n� Yeah, I've heard really good things about Ingram too. We get their brochures in the mail all the time."}
