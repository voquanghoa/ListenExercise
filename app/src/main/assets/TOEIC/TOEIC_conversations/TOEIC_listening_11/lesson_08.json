They can all meet you on Thursday at 4 p.m. but Wilma can't make it that day.\n� Well, we can't hold the meeting without Wilma. She's the chief funder for this training project. How about next Monday at 1 p.m. or Wednesday morning at 9? Do either of those work?\n� Well, most of them can make those times, but Gloria trains new apprentices each morning until 12:30.\n� All right. Let's set it for noon next Tuesday. Jason and Tom can use the first half hour to explain our organization's history, goals and past accomplishments to Wilma. When Gloria joins us, we can go over the objectives for this new project."}
