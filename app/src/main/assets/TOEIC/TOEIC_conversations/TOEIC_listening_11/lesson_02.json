Could you connect me to his extension, please?\n� I'm sorry sir, but Mr. Graham is out of the office until Wednesday. Could I connect you to someone else?\n� I'm not sure. Mitch is in charge of our account. I'm with Precious Pet Shop, and I'm calling to order three cases of dog food. We need them by the end of the week.\n� Oh I see. In that case, I'll put you through to Ms. Crockett, our product department manager. She should be able to take your order and get the dog food shipped right out to you."}
