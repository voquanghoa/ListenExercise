Pedro's wife Ida just completed her doctorate, and she's been offered a teaching position out west. She's going to start teaching in winter term.\n� Well, I'm sorry to hear that Pedro will be leaving us. He's one of the best network administrators we've ever had.\n� Yes, I enjoyed working with him. He's given standard two weeks' notice, but he has offered to stay on longer while we look for a replacement.\n� Okay, that's good to know. Let's advertise right away. If Pedro is willing to stay until Ida starts her new job, then he could spend the next two months training the new person. That way when Pedro goes, all his expertise with our system won't be lost."}
