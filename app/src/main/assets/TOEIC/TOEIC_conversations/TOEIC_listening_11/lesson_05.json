I haven't seen you since the company dinner last spring. Are you still in the accounts department in the McClure Building?\n� Preston, it's good to see you again! I've been away most of the summer, doing professional development training. The company sent me to Ohio to learn about database programming so that I can transform our current accounting procedures.\n� Really? That sounds great. I'm hoping to take a sabbatical too next year.. in Florida. Would you mind if I asked you some questions about your experience this summer?\n� Not at all. Let's do lunch, and you can fill me in on everything that I missed while I was away. It looks like the fifteenth floor has been renovated."}
