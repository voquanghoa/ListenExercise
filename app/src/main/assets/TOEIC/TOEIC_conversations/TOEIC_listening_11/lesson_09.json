I just got off the phone with the event coordinator, and she said there are going to be an extra twenty exhibitors. We're going to need twenty extra booths.\n� Well, usually this wouldn't be a problem, because we have 150 booths at the exhibition hall, and the computer fair booked 125 booths. But fifteen of them don't have electricity right now.\n� I see. Well, we still have three days 'til the weekend. Do you think you could rig up some tables with stand-alone displays behind them? That way we could set them up near the outlets.\n� I don't know. Tables and folding dividers are easier to get at this stage than booths. But I'll see what I can do."}
