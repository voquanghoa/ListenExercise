He wants to know if you're satisfied with the terms outlined in the fax he sent yesterday. He also said he'll need you to sign the memorandum by Wednesday.\n� Oh, that's right. He wants to get a press release out before the weekend. Would you please e-mail him today and let him know we have the fax?\n� Sure. Should I tell him you'll sign the memo as well?\n� No, not quite yet. I need to have the marketing team review it first. I'll give marketing a deadline of Tuesday, so if everything looks good, tell Mr. Chow we can get the memo to him by Thursday morning."}
