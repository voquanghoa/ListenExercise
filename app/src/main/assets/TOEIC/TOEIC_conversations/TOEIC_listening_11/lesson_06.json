Traffic was bumper-to-bumper. Wow, the line is really long! Are all these people here for the same movie we are? I hope we'll be able to get in.\n� Why don't you stay in line, and I'll go check out that automatic ticket machine. It seems like you can buy tickets using a bank card. And that line is moving quicker than this one.\n� Okay. Well, if the movie's sold out, I suppose we could always walk down the street and see a different film at the Varsity. That theater is never busy.\n� Let's do this. If I reach the front of the line before you do, I'll call you over. And vice versa."}
