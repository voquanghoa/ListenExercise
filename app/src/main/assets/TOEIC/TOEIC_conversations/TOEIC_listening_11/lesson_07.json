It completely slipped my mind. Anyway, I just got ahold of her, and she can't sell tickets at the dance tomorrow night.\n� I was afraid that might be the case. Do we have any backups?\n� Yeah, fortunately Nancy from the cafeteria is on standby. The only thing is, she hasn't done this before, so we'll need to train her before tomorrow evening.\n� Well that's fine, but you'll have to take care of it yourself, Dave. I'll be downtown this afternoon helping the musicians get organized. And tomorrow morning I'll be at Driscoll Hall supervising the caterers."}
