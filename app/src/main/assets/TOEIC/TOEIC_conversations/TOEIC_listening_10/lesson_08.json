My flight to Boston's been delayed until 8 o'clock, but I need to be there by 5. Do you have any other flights I can take?\n� We have flights that leave at 2 and 3:30. But they're both full. I could book you on standby for each of them. If someone doesn't show up, you can have their seat.\n� What do you think my chances are of getting on? I have an important meeting that I really can't miss.\n� Well, there are two passengers ahead of you on the standby list. If you want to make sure you get to Boston on time, I could refund your money and you could try another airline."}
