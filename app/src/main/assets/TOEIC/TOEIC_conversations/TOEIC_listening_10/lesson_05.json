You can transfer at Central Station.\n� OK. I can catch the orange line at the Third Street Station just around the corner, can't I?\n� Yes. Take that line five stops to Central Station. From there catch the blue line, going west. Get off the blue line at the seventh stop; that'll be Straight Street. Exit the terminal by the north stairs, turn right, and walk one block to the stadium. To come back, just reverse the process."}
