Did you have a good weekend?\n� Yes, I did. On Saturday we went hiking at Trout Lake, and yesterday we saw Titanium Man.\n� Oh I've seen that. Isn't it great? The action scenes were awesome! And I think Richard Crowley Jr. should win the Oscar for best actor!\n� Yeah, Crowley Jr. was superb. But I thought the movie was so-so. It was too long, and wasn't as suspenseful as I thought."}
