The yard looks fantastic, and it's nice to have the bushes trimmed. I was wondering if you could do me a small favor?\n� I'll try, ma'm.\n� Could you please hold this check until Thursday. I don't get paid 'til then, and I don't want it to bounce.\n� Sure, no problem. I know how it is with a bounced check. We'll both have to pay fees.
