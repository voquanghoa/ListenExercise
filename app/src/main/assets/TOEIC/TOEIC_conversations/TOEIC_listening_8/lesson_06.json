You don't usually ride the bus.\n� I know. My car's in the shop, so I thought I'd give this a try.\n� Careful, you might become addicted. Riding the bus is great!\n� Sure -- if you like to wait forever and walk for miles.\n� Actually, the bus comes every 20 minutes. And it stops only a half-block away from our building. The best thing is the price: $15 a month with an annual pass. That's less than a tank of gas."}
