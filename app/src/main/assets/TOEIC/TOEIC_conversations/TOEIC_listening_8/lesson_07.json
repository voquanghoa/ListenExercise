Have a seat. I need to talk with you about this quarter's figures. It seems that sales have dropped again. They're down 15 percent from last year.\n� I know, Mr. Fenner. I'm frustrated too. My team is working quite hard, but so far the results have been disappointing.\n� What do you think the problem is? Do we need to make changes to the sales team?\n� I think it's the partly economy, and partly because we had some turnover at the start of the year. I don't think we need to make changes at this time, but we might soon if things don't improve."}
