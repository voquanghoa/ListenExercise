He said the owners are willing to come down to $2,000 a month for the office on Water Street.\n� That's still too high. Besides, I'd prefer not to move downtown. Did Mr. Munson say anything about the suites in the Mason Building on Magnolia Boulevard?\n� He said he's still waiting to hear back from the Mason Building's owner. Oh, he also asked if we'd be interested in a 1,500-square foot office in Pineville.\n� Hmm. Pineville's nice, but that's too small. The way we're growing, we need 2,000 square feet at the minimum."}
