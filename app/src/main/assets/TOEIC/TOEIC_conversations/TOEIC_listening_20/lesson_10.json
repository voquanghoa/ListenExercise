What do you think?\n� Well, Carlton Brothers' was the cheapest, but I'm not sold on the quality of their work. I think they cut too many corners to bring the price down. The bid from Stuller & Sons is 15 percent higher, but I think it's worth the extra cost. How about you?\n� Carlton Brothers did a project for my friend's company, and she thought they did a great job. I don't know much about Stuller & Sons, but I liked some of the suggestions in their bid -- like using track lighting instead of canned. I think you're probably right.\n� Let's recommend Stuller to the board of directors tomorrow, then. Of course, they still to get to vote on it, but they usually follow the staff recommendation"}
