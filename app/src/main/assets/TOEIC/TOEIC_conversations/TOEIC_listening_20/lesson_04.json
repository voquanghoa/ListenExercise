This is Carolyn. I've run into a problem with the schedule tomorrow. Our 10 o'clock presenter, Dr. Fitzsimmons, is stuck at the St. Louis airport. The soonest flight he can catch won't get him here until 10:30.\n� All right. He'll need to rest and eat. Why don't we switch his morning session for one of the 2 o'clock sessions?\n� That's a good idea. I'll check with our 2 o'clock presenters and see if one of them will change.\n� Let me know as soon as you've arranged it. I'll get a sign posted at the registration table."}
