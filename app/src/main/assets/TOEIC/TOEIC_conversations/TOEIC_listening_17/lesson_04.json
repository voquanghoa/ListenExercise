This is Debra. I'm on my way to Jim's office, but I'm a bit confused.\n� Where are you?\n� I'm at the 24th Street Station. Should I go north or south on 24th?\n� Actually, the best thing to do would be to ride two more stops, to Alder Street. At the Alder Street Station, go out the east door and turn left. Walk down Alder about two blocks to 24th, and turn right. Jim's office will be a half-block down on the right hand side."}
