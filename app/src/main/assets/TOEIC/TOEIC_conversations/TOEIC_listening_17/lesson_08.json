I called, and they said they were having problems with their fax machine. They're trying to fix it.\n� Mr. Ramon needs to review that document as soon as possible. It's the new service contract for our office PCs. \n� I'll phone Chris and see how they're doing. If the machine's still down, I'll have him scan and e-mail it instead. Either way, I'll run it Mr. Ramon's office as soon as it arrives."}
