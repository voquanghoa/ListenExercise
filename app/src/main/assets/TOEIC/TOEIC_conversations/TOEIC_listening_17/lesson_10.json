Now to JC. How are you coming with arrangements for the exposition this weekend?\n� We have a bit of a problem. There was a last-minute rush of vendors, so we need 10 more booths, and we have to amend the programs to include all the extra names and information. \n� OK. Corey, can you find someone in your department to help arrange for more booths? And Michelle, can you please get someone to proof the programs when they're ready. Is there anything else?\n� We need to order more food from the caterers, but I can have someone take care of that."}
