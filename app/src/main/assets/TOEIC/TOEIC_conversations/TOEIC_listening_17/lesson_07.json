You work my Friday shift, and I'll work your Monday shift?\n� Sorry Frank, I can't do that this week. It's too short a notice; I already have plans. Have you checked with Tim? He was saying that he needs extra hours.\n� Yes I have. In fact, I've checked with everyone else. You're my last hope.\n� If you can wait, I can trade with you next Friday no problem."}
