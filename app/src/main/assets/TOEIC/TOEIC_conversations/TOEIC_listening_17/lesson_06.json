We need to order printing paper, and I wanted to inquire about your bulk rates. We're going to need 100 reams of white paper, and 300 reams of colored paper.\n� Thank you for calling. For the white paper, we offer a 10-percent discount, so that would be $50 per ream. For the colored paper, we offer a 20-percent discount. It's more expensive, so that would be $65 per ream.\n� OK, thanks. I called Super Warehouse, and their prices are $40 a ream for the white and $55 for the color, so I think we'll go with them.\n� Hmm. Forty and 55? I'll beat those prices by 5 percent, if you'll order from us instead."}
