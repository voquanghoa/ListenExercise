With all those books and papers, it looks like you're cramming for a final exam.\n� I am, in a way. I'm studying for my medical board certification next month. Nurses have to be re-certified every five years, to be sure we're up-to-date with the latest health practices. It's a four-hour test.\n� I see. Don't worry too much. You've been a nurse for 12 years, so you've already passed two of these. I'm sure you'll pass again -- with flying colors!\n� Thanks. I hope so. There have been a lot of changes in the field since my last medical board exam. I'm trying to catch up on all of them."}
