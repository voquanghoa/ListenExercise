This is Martha Hadley at 274 Bagley Boulevard. I'm having trouble with my cable TV, and I need someone to come to my home and fix it. This is the third time I've called!\n� Oh, I'm terribly sorry ma'm. What seems to be the trouble?\n� There's a loose connection with the main cable wire into my home, so none of my cable channels come in clearly. They're all fuzzy. I've already told you that! I called three days ago, and you said you'd come out the next day. I waited all day, but nobody came!\n� My apologies, Ms. Hadley. I can assure you we will have someone there tomorrow morning at 8 a.m. sharp."}
