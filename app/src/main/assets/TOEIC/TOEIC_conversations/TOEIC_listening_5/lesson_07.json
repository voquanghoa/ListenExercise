Do you have a minute?\n� Sure, Mandy. What's the matter?\n� I pressed the print button on the computer, but nothing happens. I checked, and the printer's plugged in. Can you check it out?\n� Let me see. Oh, here's the problem. The driver for the printer hasn't been installed on your computer. You need to use the CD-ROM that came with the printer to install the driver. After you put the CD-ROM in, just follow the instructions on the screen."}
