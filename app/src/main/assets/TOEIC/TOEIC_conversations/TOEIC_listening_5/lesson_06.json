I saw the article on your firm in the Times. Nice picture of Mr. Kramer.\n� Yes, it was a good shot. The writer was basically accurate, but unfortunately he got a couple of things wrong. First, he said that Mr. Kramer is worth of $1.5 million dollars. Actually, it's $1.5 billion.\n� Yeah, I thought that figure sounded too low. What was the other mistake?\n� Well, he reported that we were the seventh largest firm in our industry. Actually, we're the second largest."}
