Our manager hand-picks them himself. Your wife is sure to love them!\n� They all look pretty, but I'm not sure which kind of ring she'll like. There are so many to choose from!\n� Might I suggest shopping by price range, then. If you tell me your budget, I can suggest a smaller range of options, and I'm sure you'll find something to your liking. Also, we offer a full money-back guarantee, so if your wife doesn't like it or wants to exchange, it's no problem.\n� Oh OK, that sounds reasonable. Well, let's see. I was hoping to spend no more than $400, though I might be willing to go a little higher if I find a ring that really looks good."}
