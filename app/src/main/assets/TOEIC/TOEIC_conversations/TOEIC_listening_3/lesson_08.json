Back from vacation are you? You look tanned and rested. It's good to see you, actually. While you were gone we ran into a problem with the Martin account. You see, you were away, and Gino was out sick for a week, so we missed our deadline to present the new advertising campaign to Mr. Jeffries. We've rescheduled the presentation for Friday.\n� Friday? That's a tight deadline. All right, let's get Gino and meet in the conference room in half an hour. Bring all the design sketches that you've worked up, and have Gino bring all the ad copy he's written. I'll grab the old power point slides and videos of Martin's current commercials.\n� Right. Look, I know it's not much time, but I think we'll be OK. I've been working hard on the artwork, and I know that Gino was writing at home even though he was ill. We'll put our noses to the grindstone the next couple of days and everything will pull together. Don't worry, we're going to win this account!"}
