Next on the agenda is a report from the research department. Laura, how are you coming on the new web browser?\n� Well, the project is a little behind schedule, because last month's storm delayed a shipment of computer chips from Taiwan. But we're testing a prototype browser, and hope to have it in beta stage within eight weeks, which will be an exciting step for the company. This browser will host an internet platform, meaning all customers will need is our browser to access the World Wide Web.\n� That's exciting news, indeed, Laura! Do you have all the components you need now to complete the testing before it goes to beta? Is there anything else we need to order?\n� We should have everything we need, barring unforeseen circumstances. Hashkeem and Martin are working on the prototype practically 24/7, and they'll let me know if anything unexpected comes up."}
