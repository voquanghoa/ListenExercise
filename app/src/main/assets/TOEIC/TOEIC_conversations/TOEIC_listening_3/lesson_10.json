Your review will go into your file, which is part of your permanent employment record. It will be considered in determining salary, but it's just one factor among many. We'll also consider your overall performance since you joined the company, and any improvement made following this evaluation. In general, you're doing very nice work. Keep up the good work, and you shouldn't have any worries.\n� Thank you, Ms. Donaldson. I appreciate your fairness, and I enjoy working for you."}
