This is Victoria Balderston in corporate headquarters. The reason I'm calling is that I haven't received last month's expense reports from your office yet, and they were due on Tuesday. Was this something that was overlooked?\n� No, I actually sent them to you on Monday with the company courier. I'm sure of it. You haven't received them yet? That's strange.\n� Yes, it is. Listen, I can check with the courier's office, but in the meantime, could you send please the expense reports again today, just to ensure that I have them by this afternoon? I'd really appreciate it.\n� Sure, no problem. Let's see, it's 8:45. I'll try to get them on the 9 o'clock courier run, but if I miss that I'll have them ready for the 11 o'clock pickup. Sorry about the confusion."}
