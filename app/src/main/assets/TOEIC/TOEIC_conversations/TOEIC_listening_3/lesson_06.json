Theresa Blanding speaking.\n� Yes Ms. Blanding, My name is Tony Dodd, I have a complaint about your service. I used Mighty Maids yesterday, and the woman who cleaned my home -- Nora, is her name -- did not do a very good job. I asked her to scrub the bathroom floors, but when she finished, they looked no cleaner than before she started. I also asked her to clean the oven and do some laundry. She did neither. I'm very disappointed, and I'd like my money back.\n� I'm terribly sorry to hear that, Mr. Dodd. Believe me, this is not typical of Mighty Maids service. Unfortunately, I cannot refund your money. However, what I can do is send a different person out tomorrow, who will clean your house this time free of charge. We'd like another chance to prove that yesterday was an aberration. Would that be OK?\n� Yes, I suppose. But if the cleaner is not good tomorrow, I will not use your service again, and I'll tell everyone I know to avoid Mighty Maids."}
