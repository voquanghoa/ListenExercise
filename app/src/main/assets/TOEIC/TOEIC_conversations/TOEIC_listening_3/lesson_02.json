I bought Microfirm last month for $20 a share. Today it's at $12.28. All my other stocks are down too, except for a couple. Maybe I should find another place to put my money.\n� Hey, Fred, I know it's rough. My portfolio's decreased too. But you have to remember that the stock market is cyclical. There are always good times and bad times. The key is to be patient. You don't need your money right away, do you?\n� No, not immediately. But I will in about 10 years. I saw a bond mutual fund yesterday that's paying 5.2 percent. And my bank is offering a three-year Certificate of Deposit at 4.5 percent.\n� Bonds and CDs have their place in a financial portfolio. But for long-term investing, there's nothing better than stocks. The stock market has averaged about a 10-percent annual return over its history. It's tough to get that kind of consistent profit anywhere else."}
