He's going to go over to the Herald. They're giving him his own column.\n� Really? Well, good for him, but I'm sorry we're losing him. He's a great reporter, and I'll miss his stupid jokes around the newsroom. How long has he been with us, about 50 years?\n� (chuckles). Only about 10 I think, but it does seem longer. He's kind of an institution at this paper. Word is that he asked the publisher, Mr. Frankel, for a column last year, but he was turned down.\n� What a shame. If anyone deserves his own column, it's Nathan Richmond. He's paid his dues, covering city politics all these years. I wonder who'll cover that beat now. Have you heard, Carla?"}
