How may I help you?\n� Yes, I'm new to the city and I'm trying to figure out how garbage and recycle collection work. It's my understanding that garbage is collected on Wednesdays, and recyclables such as paper, plastic and glass are collected on Thursdays. Is that correct?\n� No sir, it's the other way around. Recyclables are Wednesday, and garbage is Thursday. You need to put your garbage can next to the curb in front of your house by 7 a.m. Thursdays. You should have two recycling containers, one for paper and cardboard, and one for glass. Those need to be set in front of your house by 7 a.m. Wednesday. On both those days, our pick-up trucks will be there sometime between 7 and 5.\n� Oh I see. Thank you very much for your assistance. Just one more thing. I heard that the city is going to start collecting yard waste soon. Can you please tell me about that?"}
