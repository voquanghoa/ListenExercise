It's on sale for $399. What do you think?\n� That's a good price, but we should compare before we buy. I saw an ad where Video Plus promises to match any competitor's offer. And TVs might be cheaper there anyway. I think we ought to look in at least two stores before we get anything.\n� Yeah, we could, but when you figure in the cost of time and gas getting to another store, it might end up being cheaper just to buy it here right now. What if we go to Video Plus and it's not any cheaper, but they just match the price?\n� Yeah, I see your point, but I'd feel better if we could compare anyway. If the TV is only $300 at the other store, then it's worth the time and gas to go there. How about if I call Video Plus and ask them?\n� All right, that's a good idea. While you're doing that, I'm going to check out MP-4s."}
