Now I'd like to ask you a few questions. First, why do you want to join our firm?\n� Eldridge Electronics is one of the most well-respected companies in the industry. Not only for the quality of your products, but for the way employees are treated. Eldridge offers an opportunity to challenge myself, and to be fairly rewarded for doing so.\n� I see. And does your current employer know that you are in the market for a new position?\n� Not explicitly, but my manager understands that I've been there six years now, and I've basically reached the top of the ladder in terms of what I can do with them. In fact, he recently joked that he'd better find a way to keep me busy or else he'd lose me."}
