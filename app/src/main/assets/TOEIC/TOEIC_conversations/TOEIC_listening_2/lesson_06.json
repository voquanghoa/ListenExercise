Let me summarize your order. You want two cases of printer ink -- one black and one color; 50 reams of copy paper -- the bright white kind; six cartons of legal envelopes; and 50 boxes of manila folders. Is that correct?\n� Yes it is. And can I expect that to arrive within a week? We need it by next Monday.\n� With standard shipping, it will get there within 7 to 10 business days. If you need it sooner, we should use expedited shipping. That would cost $30 instead of $15 for standard, but it would guarantee arrival within 3 to 5 days.\n� Hmm... well, I guess we'll have to go with the expedited, then. Would it be possible to order additional items for the same shipping fee?\n� Sure. You could add up to 25 pounds on your order. But after that, the expedited fee would be $2 per five pounds."}
