Or should I say, \"Vice President Martenelli?\"\n� (chuckles) Not yet, Marie. It doesn't take effect until next month. I am excited about the new opportunity though. And a little scared too, to tell you the truth. It's more money, but also a LOT more responsibility. I'm not sure I'm ready for this.\n� Sure you are. And you're going to do just great! After all, Ms. Robertson wouldn't have chosen you if she didn't think you were well-qualified. You've earned your new position, so relax. I'm proud of you!\n� Thanks, Marie. Actually, I am going to relax for a while. I'm taking some vacation time and going to Mexico for a week before I start."}
