Bill Callahan rang this morning, and he wants to reschedule his meeting with you from this afternoon to 8 a.m. tomorrow. Also, Ms. Flaxon from the Bermuda Group faxed a contract proposal. It's on your desk. She'd appreciate a response by Thursday, if possible.\n� Morning, Ms. Hobbs. Yes, go ahead and move the Callahan meeting to tomorrow, then ring Paul Frazier and ask if he has time for a conference call this afternoon, say about 3. If he doesn't, let's aim for late tomorrow morning.\n� Very good sir. Also, don't forget you have a noon luncheon today at the Rotary Club.\n� Thank you. That reminds me, could you please phone Dryden's Dry Cleaners and have them deliver my blue knit suit by 11:30? I'd like to wear that to lunch."}
