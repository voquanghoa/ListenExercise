I haven't seen you since the last company party. What's new in the sales department?\n� Hello there Henry. Merry Christmas to you too! I've been busy, mate. I just got back from Hong Kong, and after the holidays I leave again for Europe. The new XP3000 is selling like hot cakes. We can't seem to keep enough in stock. How are things in accounting?\n� We've been hopping too, trying to get all the end-of-the-year sales figures done by next week. It looks like we're going to beat the industry analysts' fourth-quarter estimates by about 15 percent.\n� That's wonderful news, of course. But frankly, I could do with a bit of a rest. I hope things either cool down or we make some new hires. I've hardly had time to do Christmas shopping for my family! But anyway... cheers!"}
