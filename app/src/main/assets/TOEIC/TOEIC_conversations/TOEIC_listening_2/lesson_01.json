Three-ninety-nine a loaf? Can you believe it? Last summer it was only two-seventy-five!\n� I know. Everything's going up so fast. This coffee has jumped from four dollars to five twenty five. And eggs went from one eighty nine to three thirty two.\n� It's not just food either. My electricity bill's soaring, and I read this morning that garbage collection is going up 15 percent next year. I don't know how I'm going to afford it.\n� Me either. My salary can't keep up with inflation. Our family's had to cut back on lots of things. We just got rid of our cable television, and we're going down to one car soon."}
