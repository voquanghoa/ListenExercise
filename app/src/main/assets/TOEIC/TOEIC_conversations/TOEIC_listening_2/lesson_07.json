You see, it doesn't work properly. First of all, the numbers 5 and 9 stick when I dial. Secondly, the camera won't switch on when I want to take pictures.\n� I see. Terribly sorry about that. Our store policy is no refunds, but as long as you have your receipt, you can exchange the phone for any model of equal or lesser value. And I'll check to make sure your new phone works properly before you leave the store.\n� Thank you very much. I'll have a look around then, and decide which one I want. Do you have any recommendations?"}
