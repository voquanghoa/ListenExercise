I didn't know you rode the subway.\n� I don't usually. It's just that I'm fed up with driving and paying so much for gas, and the buses are crowded and unreliable. So I thought I'd give this a try.\n� I know what you mean. I started taking the subway two years ago, and it's wonderful! From the Scott Street station, it's only a block and a half to our building. And going home, the 52nd Street stop is only two blocks from my apartment. When I was driving, I wasn't getting nearly as much exercise.\n� Exactly! Plus, the subway's cheaper than gas in the long run. And the trains leave every 15 minutes, so if I miss one I don't have to wait long for another. So, did you say we should get off at Scott Street?"}
