Could I ask the reason why you're canceling?\n� It's just too expensive right now, and there are so many channels that we never watch. We're finding it's not a good value for our money.\n� I understand, ma'm. I see that you have our premium package. Have you considered trying a different package, such as cable basic or basic-plus? These cost less, and also give you fewer channels.\n� We've considered it, but we can't afford even basic cable right now. You see, my husband was just laid-off. So I'm afraid we'll need to cancel all cable for the time being."}
