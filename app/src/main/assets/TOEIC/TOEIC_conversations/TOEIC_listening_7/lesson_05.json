You can choose a deductible of $1,000, $2,000 or $3,000. The higher the deductible, the lower your monthly payment.\n� I see. And what are the monthly payments for each plan?\n� For a woman your age and health condition, it's $100 a month for the $1,000 deductible, then $200 and $300 for the others.\n� The payments are reasonable, but I'm worried about the choice of physicians and the types of prescription medications that are covered under your plan."}
