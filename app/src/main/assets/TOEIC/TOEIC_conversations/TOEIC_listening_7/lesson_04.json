She was terribly rude to me.\n� I'm sorry to hear that. What happened?\n� First, she seemed to ignore me, even though I was standing right in front of her counter. I stood there for five minutes before she spoke to me. Then, when I told her my toaster didn't work and I wanted my money back, she said, \"sorry, all sales are final\" and walked away.\n� Oh dear, that is a problem! Rest assured, that's not typical of our service. Now, if I could please get a little more information, I'll resolve this promptly for you."}
