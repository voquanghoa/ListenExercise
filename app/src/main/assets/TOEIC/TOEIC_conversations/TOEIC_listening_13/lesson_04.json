Here's your change. Thanks, and have a nice day!\n� Excuse me, I'm looking for the art museum. Do you know how to get there?\n� Let's see, the art museum is on 7th Avenue. The best way to get there is to go out our parking lot and turn right. Follow that street two blocks, and get into the left-hand turn lane. At the light for Mason Street, take a sharp left and go up five blocks to Seventh. Turn left. The museum will be on your right-hand side.\n� Thank you. Do you know if there's parking available at the museum?\n� Yes, there's a parking garage right next door."}
