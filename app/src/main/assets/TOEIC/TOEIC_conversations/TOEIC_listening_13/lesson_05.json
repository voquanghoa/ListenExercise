Was it as good as advertised?\n� Yeah, I thought so. Tory Brown was fantastic; he's such a superb actor! And I thought the cinematography was breath-taking! How about you?\n� It was beautifully filmed, all right, and Brown is the best at what he does. But overall I was rather disappointed. The plot was kind of thin. Overall, I don't think the film lived up to its hype."}
