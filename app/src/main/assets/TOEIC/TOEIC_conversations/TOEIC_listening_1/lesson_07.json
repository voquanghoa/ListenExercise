The phone company dropped my call again, right in the middle of the conversation! I'm fed up with Z-Mobile!\n� I use Rewired. I hardly ever get dropped, and long distance calls in the US and Canada are free. Plus, I can choose four friends to talk with each month as long as I like.\n� Really? You get unlimited minutes with four people? How much do you pay each month?\n� I pay a flat fee of $70 for up to 700 minutes, but you can choose pay-as-you-go plans too. I really like Rewired. You should check it out."}
