I think we should refinance our mortgage. I heard an ad on the radio today. It said that the interest rate right now is only 5 percent.\n� Hmm... That's a good idea. What's our mortgage payment now, about $300 a month?\n� Yes. I called the phone number on the radio ad. The gentleman said we could lower our payment to about $200 a month if we refinance soon.\n� Let's make an appointment with the mortgage company. We sure could use an extra hundred bucks each month."}
