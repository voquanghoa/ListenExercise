I've registered to attend the conference, but I haven't reserved a room yet.\n� You really should do that soon. I booked my room last week, and the hotels near the conference were already full. I'm staying ten miles from the convention center.\n� Well, if I can't get a hotel room, I've got a back-up plan. I'll just stay with my nephew. He has an apartment downtown."}
