I was wondering if you would like to play softball with us on Sunday afternoon.\n� Uh... thanks Paul. It sounds like fun, but I'm really out of shape. Besides, I haven't swung a bat or thrown a ball in years.\n� That's all right. We just play to socialize, have some fun, and get a little exercise. Don't worry about it, we're not professionals! We'd love to have you on the team, and we could really use you on Sunday. One of our players was injured during the last game.\n� Oh. In that case, then I'll see you at the field."}
