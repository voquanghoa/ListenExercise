This is Shana from Superior Catering. Your order for the office party Friday afternoon should be ready by Friday morning.\n� Oh good. Is it all right if I pick it up on Thursday? I'll be in a meeting on Friday morning.\n� I wouldn't recommend doing that. The food will spoil. We could deliver it to you on Friday morning, if you want. That way it will stay fresh.\n� Really? That would be super! Thank you."}
