This is Helen Luna at Magnum Heating Supplies. I've been going over our customer records, and I see that you currently use our Model 200 filters for your heating systems. I'm just calling to ask: have you considered upgrading to the Model 201 filters?\n� I guess it's a possibility, but the 200's seem to be doing the job just fine for us.\n� Well, the reason I ask is that for the next 90 days the Model 201 filters will be on sale for the same price as the Model 200's you're using now, so this would be a good time to change to the newer model.\n� Interesting. Well, why don't you send me some more information and I'll consider it."}
