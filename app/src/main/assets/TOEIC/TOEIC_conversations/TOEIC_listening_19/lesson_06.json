This is Conway Contractors, here to assist you with all your home needs. How may I help you?\n� Hi. My name's Lenora Steele, and one of your workers came to my house yesterday and gave me an estimate for remodeling my basement. I'd like to accept the bid and have the work done, but I'm not sure how to proceed.\n� Let's see. Steele�oh, here it is. Well, you're going to need to get a permit from the city planning office for the construction work, and from City Light for the electrical wiring. Then you can call us back to schedule it for some time next month.\n� OK, but I thought you'd be able to start next week. At least, that's what your worker told me."}
