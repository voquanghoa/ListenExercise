Yes, I need two rooms with double beds for the 15th through 17th, please.\n� Let me see...I'm sorry, all our double rooms are booked for that weekend. We have rooms with queen beds and king beds available.\n� Hmm...the problem is, we need separate beds. If we booked one of those rooms, would it be possible to add a cot or some other type of bed? \n� Yes it would. Cots cost $10 extra per night, or I could book a room with a fold-out couch for $20 extra."}
