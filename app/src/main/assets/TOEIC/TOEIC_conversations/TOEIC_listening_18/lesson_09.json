Could you sign this requisition for freelance pay? We need to contract with a writer to help with content for our website redesign. \n� I'll have to check with Mr. Bosworth. You know we're on a strict budget.\n� Yes, I do. Mr. Bosworth has already approved it. He said we need to get the new website up as soon as possible. Our designers are working overtime, so we need outside help with writing and editing.\n� I believe you, but I still need to hear it from Mr. Bosworth directly. He's in a meeting now. Leave the form with me, and I'll check with him when he's through then send it to your desk.\n� OK, thanks. Meanwhile, I'll have the freelancer get started."}
