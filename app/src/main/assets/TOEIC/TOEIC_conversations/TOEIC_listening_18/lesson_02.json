He doesn't return my e-mails, and I've left two voice messages. I need to talk with him soon about renewing our contract. \n� I'm sure it's nothing personal. He's probably been busy. Have you tried dropping in in person? It's only a couple of blocks away from our building.\n� That's a good idea! I should swing by and invite him to lunch. Everybody likes a free meal. \n� Yes, then you can discuss the contract while you eat."}
