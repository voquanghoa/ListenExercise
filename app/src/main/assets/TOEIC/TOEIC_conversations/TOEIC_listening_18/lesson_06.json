OK, I think I'm lost. I got off at Sandusky Street, but I don't see West Vine Avenue. I've gone five blocks; now I'm at Sandusky and Pine.\n� Pine? Oh, you went west on Sandusky. You should have turned east when you got off. Turn around and head the other way on Sandusky. After it goes under the freeway, West Vine will be the second intersection.\n� Thanks. Which way should I turn on West Vine? \n� Turn right. The post office will be about a half-block down on the left-hand side, next to the furniture factory."}
