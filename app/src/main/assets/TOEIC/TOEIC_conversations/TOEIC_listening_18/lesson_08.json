Mark Peterson and Misty Chambers. Whom do you prefer?\n� Well, it's close, but I like Ms. Chambers. She has more experience, and I thought she handled herself well under pressure during the second interview, when there were four evaluators.\n� I agree that she has more experience, but Mr. Peterson seems more creative and is very talented. His industry award for computer design is impressive. \n� It's your call. I'd be happy with either of them. Either one would be a great addition to our team."}
