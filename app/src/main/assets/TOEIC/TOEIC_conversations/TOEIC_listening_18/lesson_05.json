This is Macy Cousins at Darby & Dodge. I'm calling to see if you've had time to review the proposed revisions to our contract. \n� Thank you Ms. Cousins. We received the contract last week. Our attorneys are still looking at it. I'm told they think it looks good, but are making some minor changes pertaining to the section on fees.\n� Do you know when you might be able to send it back to us for final approval? Mr. Darby is hoping to receive it by Friday.\n� Yes, I think we'll be able to have it to him by Friday. I'll check with our legal staff, and confirm that by this afternoon. Would that be all right?"}
