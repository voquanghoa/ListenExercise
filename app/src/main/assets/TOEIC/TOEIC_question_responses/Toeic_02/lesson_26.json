What do you think of the new boss?\nShe seems to be very efficient at delegating. \nI don't suppose she'll say very long.\nI've heard that she's moving to a new post next week.\n2). Have you filed all those documents about the accident?\nThere's too much paperwork in this office.\nI'll do that later when I'm not so busy. \nThe files really need to be sorted into alphabetical order.\n3). Is it all right to take tomorrow off as leave because I have an interview that day?\nWe already have seven vacancies on our staff.\nI suppose so but you'll have a lot of work to do when you come back. \nWhen I was younger, you had to lose a day's pay when you went on an interview."}
