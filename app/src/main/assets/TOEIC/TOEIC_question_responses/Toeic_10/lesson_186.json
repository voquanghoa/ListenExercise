Is the coffee included in the price on this menu?\nThe sweets are rather expensive, in my opinion.\nI'm not particularly thirsty at the moment.\nYes, it's an all inclusive price. \n2). The question is whether we drink coffee here or at home.\nSometimes it's surprising how much a small cup of coffee costs.\nIt's probably better to stay here and have our coffee. \nThe last time I came here the coffee was stone cold.\n3).
