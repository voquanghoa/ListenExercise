{"questions":[],"script":"Jonathan   Dorothy what are your plans for Christmas?\nDorothy   Oh yes, it's almost Christmas, isn't it. I'm not sure what I'll be doing then.\nJonathan   Well, if you don't have any plans, you family could have dinner at my house.\nDorothy   That's very nice of you, thanks. Have you finished your shopping yet?\nJonathan   No, I still have to do that. I think I'll go to the mall this weekend.\nDorothy   It's going to be really crowded at the mall. You should shop online.\nJonathan   You're right. My family loves to read, so I can probably get them all presents from Amazon.com.\nDorothy   What do you think you'll get for your wife?\nJonathan   Probably a romance novel. It seems like she's always reading one of those.\nDorothy   Don't you think you should get her something a little more expensive, like jewelry or maybe a new computer?\nJonathan   Maybe you're right. It's hard buying gifts. I think my wife has everything she wants. Maybe I should just ask her."}
