I know you're an engineer so I thought you might be able to help me.\nJason     I see. What's the problem?\nAnna      I have a file that I can't open for some reason.\nJason     What type of file is it?\nAnna      It's a Word document I've been working on. I need to finish it by tomorrow.\nJason     Were you able to open it before, on the computer you're using now?\nAnna      Yes, I was working on it last night and everything was fine, but this morning I couldn't open the file.\nJason     Do you think your computer might have a virus?\nAnna      No, I checked and there weren't any.\nJason     OK. I'm not sure what's wrong. If it's possible, email the file to me and I'll see if I can get it to open.\nAnna      OK, I'll do that when I get home. Are you going to be around tonight?\nJason     Yeah, I'll be home after 8PM. Send it to me when you get a chance and I'll call you later."}
