{"questions":[],"script":"Sara      Thomas your English is so good. How did you learn it?\nThomas    Well, in my country everyone has to take English starting in the first grade. I've been taking English courses for 12 years now.\nSara      Wow, that's interesting. I remember when we took that trip last year and visited your family. It seemed like there weren't many people that could speak with me in English.\nThomas    Oh, that's because they don't speak English that much.\nSara      But they speak it in school, right? Maybe they just didn't like me so they didn't want to talk to me.\nThomas    No, actually they liked you a lot. They told me they thought you were very nice. They are just shy. They're not use to talking with foreigners. I remember when I first came to the US. I was really nervous about speaking with people.\nSara      I see. I thought there were lots of Americans teaching English in your country.\nThomas    Yes, that's true. There are probably twice as many now as there were five years ago, but they are mostly in the cities. My family lives in the country.\nSara      I wonder why. Personally I prefer the country to the city. It's so quiet and peaceful. If I were to teach, I would want to teach in the country.\nThomas    Do you think you would want to teach someday? I know the schools around my town are looking for teachers, so if you want I can call them and get more information.\nSara      No, I don't think so. I would need to stay there for a year, and I don't think I can take that much time off work.\nThomas    Well, if you change your mind, let me know. I think you would be a really great teacher."}
