Look at my stomach.\nMelissa   How much do you weigh?\nDan       I think about 170 pounds.\nMelissa   What kind of foods do you eat?\nDan       I usually have pasta for dinner. Sometimes I get take-out or fast food if I don't have enough time to cook.\nMelissa   I was reading a diet book the other day. It said that if you eat meat and nothing else, you'll lose weight quickly.\nDan       Wow, does that work?\nMelissa   I don't know, but someone told me they tried it and lost 20 pounds.\nDan       That sounds good, but I'm not sure how long I could do that.\nMelissa   I know, once you start eating vegetables and bread again you'll probably start gaining weight.\nDan       Well, I think I'm going to try it anyway. Who's the author?\nMelissa   I can't remember. It's not that popular anymore. When I get home I'll check and give you a call."}
