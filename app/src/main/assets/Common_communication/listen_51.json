I stayed up until 2AM studying for an exam.\nShawn     I was up late last night too. The semester is almost over. I've had exams all week.\nKim       Are you going back to California after you graduate?\nShawn     I think so. After I graduate I'll probably go back home and try to get a job.\nKim       Do you know where you'd like to work?\nShawn     Not yet, but I want to be an english translator.\nKim       That'd be really cool. I'd like to be a translator too, but I don't think my english is good enough.\nShawn     Don't worry about that. Your english is better than most of my classmates.\nKim       Thanks. Where are you going now?\nShawn     I'm going to study at the library. I have to take an exam tomorrow.\nKim       Me too. How late does the library stay open?\nShawn     I think it's open until 11:30PM.\nKim       OK, Good luck.\nShawn     You too."}
