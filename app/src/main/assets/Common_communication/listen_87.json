{"questions":[],"script":"Karen     I'm going shopping. Do you want to come?\nJason     I thought you went shopping yesterday.\nKaren     I did, but an old friend called me last night and invited me to his birthday party. I need to buy a gift for him.\nJason     I see. What are you going to get him?\nKaren     I really have no idea what he likes. I haven't seen him in a long time. What do you think?\nJason     Maybe a cake?\nKaren     Well, that's a good idea, but I think I should probably get him something else, like something he can wear.\nJason     How about a sweater? I saw a really nice one in the mall the other day. Maybe we can go there and take a look.\nKaren     OK, what store was it in?\nJason     It was at Macy's. I think they're having a sale this weekend.\nKaren     Oh, that's a really nice store. I like the clothes there."}
