{"questions":[],"script":"Sharon    Hey John, can I talk to you for a minute?\nJohn      Sure, what�s up?\nSharon    I wanted to let you know about a book club I joined a couple months ago. I know you do a lot of reading so I thought you might want to come with me next month.\nJohn      Oh, that sounds like fun. When does the group meet?\nSharon    Usually the last Saturday of the month at 9:30 in the evening. Is that too late for you?\nJohn      No, I think that�s ok. What do you talk about in the group?\nSharon    Well, every month we choose a new book and then during the next meeting we discuss it.\nJohn      What book are you reading now?\nSharon    The Kite Runner.\nJohn      I�ve heard that�s a good book. What�s it about?\nSharon    It is a good book. I�m almost finished. The book is about a boy who grows up in Afghanistan during the 1980s. It�s called the Kite Runner because the main character takes part in a kite flying competition.\nJohn      That sounds really interesting. I�d love to come.\nSharon    Ok, great. The next meeting isn�t for another two weeks, so you still have time to read the book."}
