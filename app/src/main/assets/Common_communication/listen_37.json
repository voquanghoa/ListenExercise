{"questions":[],"script":"Andrew    Pam, where's the closest ATM?\nPam       It's not that far. Do you see that Yellow building over there?\nAndrew    The big one or the small one?\nPam       The big one.\nAndrew    Yes.\nPam       It's right next to it, on the right.\nAndrew    Do you know if there's a convenience store around here?\nPam       I don't think there's one around here. The closest one is on 3rd street, but that's probably closed now.\nAndrew    I really need to get some things before I leave.\nPam       Well, you could go down to 22nd street. There are lot of stores down there that are open 24 hours a day.\nAndrew    Can I take the subway to get there?\nPam       Yes, but that'll probably take about half an hour. You should just take a cab.\nAndrew    Won't that be expensive?\nPam       No, from here I think it's only about 5 dollars."}
