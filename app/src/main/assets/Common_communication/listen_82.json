{"questions":[],"script":"Kim       Hi Peter, can I talk to you for a moment. I just heard the cookie factory downtown is going out of business.\nPeter     Where did you hear that?\nKim       Sara told me.\nPeter     I'm not sure that's true. I haven't heard anything about it.\nKim       She said that they have already started to lay people off.\nPeter     Doesn't your father work there?\nKim       Yes, I'm really worried he might get laid off, he just started to work there about three months ago. What do you think I should do?\nPeter     I'd talk to your father.\nKim       Yeah, but if there was something wrong I don't think he'd tell me. He doesn't like to upset me, but I really would like to know what's going on.\nPeter     So what are you gonna do?\nKim       Aren't you good friends with the president of that company?\nPeter     Yes, we use to work together at a different company about five years ago.\nKim       Maybe you could call him and see what's going on.\nPeter     Well, I don't know. I guess I could. It's pretty late now, but I'll call him in the morning.\nKim       OK, thanks so much."}
