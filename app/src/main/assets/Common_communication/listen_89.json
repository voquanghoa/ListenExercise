What's up?\nGary      I haven't talked to you in a long time, what's been happening?\nNancy     Well, I don't know if you heard, I just moved into a new apartment in LA.\nGary      No, I heard you were thinking about moving but I didn't know you'd already found a place. That's cool.\nNancy     Yeah, I'm really happy about it.\nGary      Do you have any roommates?\nNancy     No, not this time. It's a big change for me 'cause I've never lived alone.\nGary      Don't you think you'll be lonely?\nNancy     Not really, I have two friends who live in the same building. We all had dinner together last night.\nGary      Are they students also?\nNancy     No, they're not students, but there are a lot of students living in the building.\nGary      Sounds like a nice place.\nNancy     Yeah, I think it's a good environment for learning English.\nGary      Well, I'm glad to hear everything worked out.\nNancy     You should come out here and visit me sometime. There's even a pool.\nGary      That would be nice. I'll think about it."}
