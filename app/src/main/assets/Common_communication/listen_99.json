The election is next month.\nMartin    Yes, I know. I hear about it every day on the news.\nKaren     I'm going to vote for Obama.\nMartin    I think he is a good choice, but I think McCain would make a good president also.\nKaren     I know. They're both good. It's hard to decide. McCain is older but he has more experience. Obama seems to have a lot of good ideas, but some people say he wants to raise taxes.\nMartin    I heard he wants to lower taxes. It's hard to know what the truth is. That's the reason I really don't pay attention to politics.\nKaren     Yes, it can be frustrating, but it's important and it's interesting to watch."}
