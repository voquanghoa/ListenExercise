Why don't you come back tomorrow.\nTracy     I think you're right. They're going to close soon.\nThomas    Let's go get some coffee.\nTracy     OK. Wait a minute, I have to get something out of my purse. Will you hold this for me?\nThomas    Sure. Oops.\nTracy     What happened?\nThomas    I dropped your calculator. Is it broken?\nTracy     I'm not sure. Let me have a look. No, I don't think it's broken. The button came off though. I can fix it.\nThomas    Sorry about that.\nTracy     Don't worry about it. I do that all the time. If it is broken, I have another one in my car."}
