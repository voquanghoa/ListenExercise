{"questions":[],"script":"Sharon    Hi George, do you know how to get downtown?\nGeorge    Sure. Why are you going there?\nSharon    I want to buy a new computer.\nGeorge    OK, are you driving?\nSharon    Yes.\nGeorge    Go straight down this road. When you get to the second light, take a left. Then get on the highway and take exit 52.\nSharon    That sounds really complicated. Can you tell me again? Which road do I take first?\nGeorge    You go down this road, then at the second light turn left. That road is Main street.\nSharon    OK, I think I've got it now.\nGeorge    Why are you buying a new computer anyway? Didn't you just get one a few months ago?\nSharon    Yes, but it doesn't work anymore.\nGeorge    Where did you buy it?\nSharon    At Wal-Mart.\nGeorge    I think you're computer should still be under warranty. You can bring it back to them and they'll fix it for free.\nSharon    I think you're right. I didn't think about that. I should go talk to them about it. Where is the closest Wal-Mart?\nGeorge    It's about 2 blocks from here. I have to go there to get some stuff now anyway. Do you want to follow me?\nSharon    Sure."}
