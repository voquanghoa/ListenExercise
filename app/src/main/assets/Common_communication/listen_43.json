It's a lot better than mine, and it's new.\nHenry     Where are you going?\nJudy      We're going to visit my sister in the city.\nHenry     I didn't know your sister lives in the city, when did she move there?\nJudy      About a year ago. She lives in an apartment on 3rd street, across from the public library.\nHenry     I see. It's almost 5:00 PM now, don't you think there will be a lot of traffic?\nJudy      Oh, we're not driving. We're going to take the subway. The subway only takes about 20 minutes.\nHenry     Yes, but it can be very crowded around this time. I always feel uncomfortable taking the subway.\nJudy      I take the subway to work everyday, so I'm used to it now.\nHenry     Doesn't your mother live in the city?\nJudy      Yes, she's lived there for about ten years.\nHenry     I remember when she moved there. Apartments were a lot cheaper then.\nJudy      I know what you mean. It's hard to find anything that's reasonable now.\nHenry     Have a good time. Next time you're free, give me a call and we'll go play poker.\nJudy      See you later."}
