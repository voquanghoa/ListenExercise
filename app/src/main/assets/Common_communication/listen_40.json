{"questions":[],"script":"Jerry     Ann what do you want to do tonight?\nAnn       I'd like to go see a movie.\nJerry     I heard Titanic is playing at the movie theater.\nAnn       Oh, I've heard that's a good movie. What time does it start?\nJerry     6:30PM. It's a long movie. I think it lasts for about 3 hours.\nAnn       Will you come and pick me up?\nJerry     What time?\nAnn       I think we should get there early because they might be sold out. Is 5:00PM OK?\nJerry     Yes, that'll be fine. I'll meet you at your house at 5:00PM.\nAnn       Do you want to get something to eat before the movie?\nJerry     I'm not sure there will be enough time for that. We can have popcorn and hot dogs at the theater if you want.\nAnn       I don't like the popcorn they have there. I think they put too much salt on it.\nJerry     OK then, I'll pick you up a little earlier and we can go to the Thai restaurant next to the theater, is that OK?\nAnn       Yes, I like that place."}
