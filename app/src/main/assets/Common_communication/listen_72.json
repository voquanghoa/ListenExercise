We're late so we'd better not stop.\nLinda     We've passed that same store three times already. I think we're lost. We should ask someone for directions.\nRobert    We're not lost.\nLinda     I've never gone this way before. Do you know where you're going?\nRobert    Yes, this road goes through town. It's faster than the highway.\nLinda     OK. Would you mind driving a little slower please?\nRobert    Sure, no problem.\nLinda     Did you see that sign back there? I think this is a one way street.\nRobert    No, I didn't see it. I'm going to have to turn around.\nLinda     You can't turn around here. I think you should let me drive.\nRobert    I think you're right. I'm getting tired."}
