You don't have a license? I thought everyone had a license.\nMichael   No, I've lived in cities all my life and when I'm at home I usually take the subway or bus.\nJulie     I see. Do you think you'll learn to drive in the future?\nMichael   Yes. I plan to buy a car next year. I think you need one in the US.\nJulie     Actually, now that I think about it, a lot of people in cities here take the bus also.\nMichael   Well, I'd like to travel more. I've been here for a few months already and I feel like I haven't seen anything yet.\nJulie     How are you going to learn to drive? Do you want me to teach you?\nMichael   No, I wouldn't want to trouble you. I've already signed up for a class near my house. It starts next month."}
