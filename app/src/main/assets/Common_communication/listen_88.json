{"questions":[],"script":"Tim       Hey Diane, what are you doing here?\nDiane     Hi, Tim, how are you? I'm waiting for a friend.\nTim       I heard you're going to graduate this summer. Is that true?\nDiane     Yes. If everything goes alright, I'll be getting my bachelors degree in August. Then I need to start looking for a job.\nTim       I had to do that last year. It wasn't easy. Do you have any job offers?\nDiane     No, not yet. I sent out a lot of resumes, but I didn't receive many responses. It's pretty hard to find a job right now.\nTim       What's your major?\nDiane     Psychology.\nTim       That was my major when I started college, but I switched to engineering after the first year.\nDiane     I think it's easier for engineers to find a job.\nTim       I'm not sure about that. It took me about 3 months to find a job. I finally was able to get a job after I put my resume on one of those job websites.\nDiane     Anyway, it really doesn't matter. If I can't find a job I'll probably go back to school to get my Masters degree."}
