{"questions":[],"script":"Eric      Hi Anna, come in.\nAna       Wow, your apartment is a mess.\nEric      I know, I didn't have time to put things away before you got here.\nAna       Look! Are those all your clothes on the couch?\nEric      Yes.\nAna       Are they clean?\nEric      Actually most of them are dirty. I haven't done laundry in a while. I usually wait until I can do it at my parent's house.\nAna       My sister and I usually go to the laundromat down the street. Why don't you go there?\nEric      I know I should, but that place isn't very convenient. You have to wait for a long time.\nAna       Yes I know. I have to do it every week. Anyway, are you ready to go?\nEric      No I'm not ready yet. I still have to brush my teeth and wash my face. Can you wait for a few minutes?\nAna       OK, but please hurry. I think the restaurant is closing soon."}
