All you have to do is find the right one.\"\nA: \"But that's the hard part. I always fall for the guy who is smart. And then after a couple of months, I get bored.\"\nB: \"Doesn't a tall, good looking guy turn you on?\"\nA: \"Not really. What should I do?\"\nB: \"We should go to a club this Saturday and find a smart romantic guy. How does that sound?\"\nA: \"That sounds like a plan. Let's do it.\"\nB: \"Great. I'll see you at nine then.\"\nA: \"Ok. See you later.\""}
