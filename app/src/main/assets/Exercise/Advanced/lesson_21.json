What did you do last weekend?\"\nB: \"Josh had a bunch of guys over at his house and we played poker.\"\nA: \"Why didn't you guys call me?\"\nB: \"We did. But you weren't home.

What was the bid amount?\"\nB: \"We started playing no limit. It's so much fun.\"\nA: \"That sounds awesome. Let me join you next time.\"\nB: \"No problem. Just get a cell phone so we can contact you.\"\nA: \"Aright. Who won though?\"\nB: \"John. He always wins. He's damn good.\"\nA: \"You only played one game?\"\nB: \"We played 2 games and he won both of them.\"\nA: \"What is the buy in?\"\nB: \"Only 10 bucks.\"\nA: \"That sounds fun.

Give me a call Friday morning and I'll let you know the exact time.\""}
