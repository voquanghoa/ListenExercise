I shot a 13.\"\nA: \"Not too bad. I thought you were going to break single.\"\nB: \"I had a chance. I shot a 4 on the front nine, but the back nine killed me.\"\nA: \"What happened?\"\nB: \"My drive was totally off. All of the sudden, I started hooking the ball. I hit two balls OB, and that killed my score right there.\"\nA: \"That sucks. You could have broken single if it wasn't for the penalty strokes.\"\nB: \"Yeah. I was so frustrated after that hole. But overall, I shot well, so I'm not too disappointed. How about you? How have you been hitting lately?\"\nA: \"I hit great on the range, but when I get on the course, I can't seem to hit the ball right.\"\nB: \"That happened to me for the longest time. It just takes time and practice. When you go out on the course more often, that problem will fix itself.\"\nA: \"I'm still trying to break 90. I've been hitting in the mid nineties for ever.\"\nB: \"How far does your driver go?\"\nA: \"I don't use it that much. I use my 3 wood more. I'm not consistent with the driver to use it.\"\nB: \"You gotta keep practicing with it. Eventually you'll get the hang of it.\"\nA: \"Yeah. I practice with it on the range, but I'm not making any progress on it.\"\nB: \"Let's go to the range together and I'll check out your swing.\"\nA: \"That sounds good. Let's go tomorrow night.\"\nB: \"Ok. That will give us practice for our round on Wednesday.\"\nA: \"I'll meet you there at 6:30.\"\nB: \"Ok. See you tomorrow then.\""}
