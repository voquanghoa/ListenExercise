But I don't have someone to diet with. If we help each other and motivate each other, then I think we can lose some weight.\"\nB: \"I like ice cream too much though.\"\nA: \"C'mon. You'll feel better and look better and as a reward you can eat a little bit of ice cream here and there.\"\nB: \"It does sound appealing.\"\nA: \"It's a great idea.
