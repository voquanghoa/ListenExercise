I forgot about registration. I'm a day late, so all the classes are mostly full. What do you think I should do?\"\nB: \"You're screwed. You can't do anything about that. You have to hope that you get some classes that will be useful.\"\nA: \"Do you think going to the registration building will help at all.\"\nB: \"No. They will tell you the same thing in a worse way.\"\nA: \"Did you register yet?\"\nB: \"Of course. Registering for classes is not something you want to miss.\"\nA: \"What classes do you think are still open?\"\nB: \"Well, I know psychology 101 is a big class, so there will always be seats in that class. You can also get into Sociology.\"\nA: \"That's helpful. Thanks. But what do you think about philosophy. I wanted to take that class this semester.\"\nB: \"I took that class last year. The professor is really cool, so if you go to his office, you can have him sign a card that will let you in even if the class is full.\"\nA: \"He does that?\"\nB: \"I guess that's because so many people drop out of that class.\"\nA: \"That makes sense. I think I'll do that. Thanks for all the help.\"\nB: \"No problem man.\""}
