I'm going to the supermarket to pick up food and drink for Saturday's picnic later. Any suggestions?\nDave: Well, everyone has been talking about having a barbecue down by the river, so why don't you pick up some hamburger and hot dogs?\nScott: Okay, but how much hamburger meat are we going to need? And hot dogs too?\nDave: Uh, I don't know. How about three pounds of hamburger and a couple packages of hot dogs?\nScott: Oh, that's not going to be enough. Do you remember the last picnic we went on? Your roommate, Jim, ate about ten hamburgers by himself!\nDave: You're right. Let's see. I'd better write this down. Uh, let's see about nine pounds of hamburger meat and, uh . . . , seven packages of hot dogs.\nScott: And you better pick up some chicken for those who don't like hamburger or hot dogs.\nDave: Okay. How about five or six bags of potato chips?\nScott: Humm. Better make that eight or so.\nDave: Alright. Oh, and we're gonna [going to] need some hamburger and hot dog buns. How about five packages a piece? I think that sounds about right.\nScott: Yeah, you better pick up some mustard, catchup, and mayonnaise too.\nDave: Okay. What else? Uh, we're gonna [going to] need some soft drinks. How about ten of those big 2-liter bottles?\nScott: Sounds fine, but be sure to buy a variety of drinks.\nDave: Okay. And what about dessert?\nScott: Well, maybe we could ask Kathy to make a few cherry pies like she did last time.\nDave: Well, I wouldn't mind that, but you know, she's been very busy working two jobs, so I'd hate to ask her, [Oh, hum . . . ] and uh . . . Hey, why don't you whip up some of your oatmeal cookies? [Well . . .] Hey, you could even ask, uh . . . , what's her name . . . yeah that new girl, Susan, the one that moved in across the street! [Well . . .] I bet she'd be willing to help you! [I don't know . . . ] She's a real knockout!\nScott: Nah, I don't think I could ask her . . .[Ahh!] I don't know her phone number, plus . . .\n[ Door bell rings . . . ]\nDave: Hey, you don't need to. She's at the door!\nScott: What do you mean?\nDave: Well, I thought you two would hit it off, so I called her up saying I was you, and I invited her over to watch a movie.\nScott: You did what???\nDave: Wait, wait, wait . . . [uhhhhh . . . ]"}
