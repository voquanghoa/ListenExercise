I'm looking for a Father's Day gift.\nMan: Okay. How about getting your father a new wallet?\nGirl: Hmm. How much is that wallet?\nMan: Huh . . . which one?\nGirl: The black one.\nMan: Oh. It's only $40.95.\nGirl: Huh? That's too expensive for me. Do you have a cheaper one?\nMan: Hmm. How about this brown leather one?\nGirl: Umm. . . I don't think my father will like the design on the outside, and it doesn't have a place to put pictures. How much is it anyway?\nMan: It's $25.99.\nGirl: Humm. I don't have that much money.\nMan: Okay. How much money do you have to spend?\nGirl: I'm not sure [money falling on the table]. Probably about ten dollars or so. I've been helping my mom around the house for the past week to earn some money. This is all I have.\nMan: Hmm. How about this tie?\nGirl: That's real pretty, but the price tag says $13.99, and I know I don't have that much money.\nMan: Well, let's just say the tie went on sale. How about $5.00. What do you say?\nGirl: Oh, thanks. I'll take it."}
