What was your name again. I can't keep straight all the students' names this being the second day of school.\nStudent: It's okay. I have a hard time remembering names myself.\nTeacher: How, uh, Karen, right?\nStudent: No, it's Nancy. My mom's name is Karen.\nTeacher: Nancy. Okay. I think I heard you were from England.\nStudent: Well, I was born there, but my parents are American. I grew up in France.\nTeacher: Oh, a world traveller!\nStudent: But then we moved here when I was nine.\nTeacher: So, what does your father do now?\nStudent: Well, he's a college professor, and he is in Scotland at the moment.\nTeacher: How interesting. What does he teach?\nStudent: Oh, I haven't a clue. Nah, just joking. He teaches chemistry.\nTeacher: Oh, chemistry, and uh, what about your mother?\nStudent: She works full time at home.\nTeacher: Oh, and what, does she have her own business or something?\nStudent: Nah, she takes care of me.\nTeacher: Well, being a homemaker can be a real hard, but rewarding job.\nStudent: I think so too."}
