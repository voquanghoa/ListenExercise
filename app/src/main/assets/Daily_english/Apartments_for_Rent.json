And how's your new apartment working out?\nAnn: Well, that's what I'm calling about. You see, I've decided to look for a new place.\nRoger: Oh, what's the problem with your place now? I thought you liked the apartment.\nAnn: Oh, I do, but it's a little far from campus, and the commute is just killing me. Do you think you could help? I thought you might know more about the housing situation near the school.\nRoger: Okay, what's your budget like? I mean how much do you want to spend on rent?\nAnn:Uh, somewhere under $200 a month, including utilities, if I could. Oh, and I'd prefer to rent a furnished apartment.\nRoger: Hmm. And anything else?\nAnn:Yeah, I need a parking space.\nRoger: Well, I know there's an apartment complex around the corner that seems to have a few vacancies. I'll drop by there on my way to class today.\nAnn: Hey, thanks a lot.\nRoger: No problem."}
