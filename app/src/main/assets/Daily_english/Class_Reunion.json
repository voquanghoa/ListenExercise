Well, he married Sarah Rogers, and they are in charge of the event. So, what do you think? Are you going?\nJames: I don't know. I never really fit in in high school. I was kind of a loner.

It could be a little awkward.\nAmanda: Hey, why don't we go together?\nJames: Are you sure?\nAmanda: Yeah.\nJames: Well, sure. Why not. To be honest, I always thought you were very nice. I just never had the guts to ask you out.\nAmanda: Well, here's your chance.\nJames: Sounds great. So, what's your number so I can call you?\nAmanda: It's 435-923-6017.\nJames: 6017, Okay.
