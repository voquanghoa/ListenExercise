I forgot about that.\nJoshua: You ALWAYS forget.\nFather: I guess I do. How much do I owe you?\nJoshua: Just $13.\nFather: Thirteen dollars!? Why do I owe you that much? Just seems like I paid you the other day.\nJoshua: No. You forget every Saturday, and it has been piling up.\nFather: Well, I'm not sure if I have that much.\nJoshua: Go to the bank. You have lots of money.\nFather: Lots of money, uh? Uh, well, I think the bank is closed.\nJoshua: Then, what about your secret money jar under your bed?\nFather: Oh, I guess I could do that. So, what are you going to do with the money?\nJoshua: I'm going to put some in savings, give some to the poor people, and use the rest to buy books.\nFather: Well, that's sounds great, Joshua."}
