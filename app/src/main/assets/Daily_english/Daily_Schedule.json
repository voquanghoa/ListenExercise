You always seem so busy.\nMan: Well, I usually get up around 5:00 a.m. and work on the computer until 6:00 a.m.\nWoman: Why do you get up so early?\nMan: Well, I have to leave home at twenty to seven (6:40 a.m.) so I can catch a bus at 7:00 o'clock . It takes me about twenty minutes to walk to the bus stop from my house.\nWoman: And what time do you get to work?\nMan: Uh, my bus takes about an hour to get there, but it stops right in front of my office.\nWoman: That's nice. And what time do you get off work?\nMan: Uh, around 5:00 o'clock. Then, we eat dinner around 6:30, and my wife and I read and play with the kids until 8:00 or so.\nWoman: So, when do you work on your website? You said one time that you create it at home?\nMan: Well, my wife and I often watch TV or talk until 10:00 o'clock. She then often reads while I work on my site, and I sometimes stay up until the early hours of the morning, but I try to finish everything by one or two.\nWoman: And then you get up at 5:00 a.m.?\nMan: Well, yeah, but it's important to live a balanced life. I enjoy what I do, but you have to set aside time for the family and yourself.\nWoman: I agree.\nMan: But I think my wife has the toughest job. She spends her whole day taking care of our family . . . taking the kids to school, working in the garden, buying groceries, taking the kids to piano lessons . . . [Wow!] It's a full-time job, but she enjoys what she does.\nWoman: Well, it sounds like you're a busy, but lucky man.\nMan: I think so too."}
