May I help you?\nCaller: Yes, this is Jack Kordell from Hunter's Office Supplies. May I speak to Elaine Strong, please?\nSecretary: I'm sorry, but she's not in right now.\nCaller: Okay, do you know when she'll be back?\nSecretary: Uh, yes, she should be here later on this afternoon maybe about 4:30. May I take a message?\nCaller: Yes. Ms. Strong sent me a brochure detailing your newest line of laptop computers with a description of other software products, but there wasn't any information about after-sales service.\nSecretary: Oh, I'm sorry. Would you like me to fax that to you?\nCaller: Yes, but our fax is being repaired at the moment, and it won't be working until around 2:30. Hum . . . could you try sending that information around 3:30? That should give me time to look over the material before I call Ms. Strong, say, around 5:00.\nSecretary: Sure. Could I have your name, telephone number, and fax number, please?\nCaller: Yes. Jack Kordell and the phone number is 560-1287. And the fax number is 560-1288.\nSecretary: Okay. Jack Kordell. Is your name spelled C-o-r-d-e-l?\nCaller: No. It's Kordell with a \"K\" and two \"l's.\" K-o-r-d-e-l-l.\"\nSecretary: All right, Mr. Kordell. And your phone number is 560-1287, and the fax number is 560-1288. Is that correct?\nCaller: Yes it is.\nSecretary: All right. I'll be sure to send you the fax this afternoon.\nCaller: Okay, bye."}
