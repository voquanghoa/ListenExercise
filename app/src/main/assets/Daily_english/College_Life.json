Long time, no see!\nDave: Hi Maria. I was in the neighborhood, so I thought I'd drop by.\nMaria: Come on in. [Thanks.] Take a seat. Would you like anything to drink? I have Sprite or orange juice.\nDave: Sprite would be fine. Uh, so, how have you been?\nMaria: Oh, not bad. And you?\nDave: Oh, I'm doing okay, but school has been really hectic these days, and I haven't had time to relax.\nMaria: By the way, what's your major anyway?\nDave: Hotel management.\nMaria: Well, what do you want to do once you graduate?\nDave: Uh... I haven't decided for sure, but I think I'd like to work for a hotel or travel agency in this area. How about you?\nMaria: Well, when I first started college, I wanted to major in French, but I realized I might have a hard time finding a job using the language, so I changed majors to computer science. [Oh]. With the right skills, landing a job in the computer industry shouldn't be as difficult.\nDave: So, do you have a part-time job to support yourself through school?\nMaria: Well, fortunately for me, I received a four-year academic scholarship [Wow] that pays for all of my tuition and books.\nDave: Wow. That's great.\nMaria: Yeah. How about you? Are you working your way through school?\nDave: Yeah. I work three times a week at a restaurant near campus.\nMaria: Oh. What do you do there?\nDave: I'm a cook.\nMaria: How do you like your job?\nDave: It's okay. The other workers are friendly, and the pay isn't bad."}
