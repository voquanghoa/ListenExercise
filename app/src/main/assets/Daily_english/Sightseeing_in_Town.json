[Okay] Uh, here's something interesting. [Oh!]Why don't we first visit the art museum in the morning?\nMan: Okay. I like that idea. And where do you want to eat lunch?\nWoman: How about going to an Indian restaurant? [Humm] The guide recommends one downtown a few blocks from the museum.\nMan: Now that sounds great. After that, what do you think about visiting the zoo? [Oh . . umm . . well . . . ] Well, it says here that there are some very unique animals not found anywhere else.\nWoman: Well, to tell you the truth, I'm not really interested in going there. [Really?]. Yeah. Why don't we go shopping instead? There are supposed to be some really nice places to pick up souvenirs.\nMan: Nah, I don't think that's a good idea. We only have few travelers checks left, and I only have fifty dollars left in cash.\nWoman: No problem. We can use YOUR credit card to pay for MY new clothes.\nMan: Oh, no. I remember the last time you used MY credit card for YOUR purchases.\nWoman: Oh well. Let's take the subway down to the seashore and walk along the beach.\nMan: Now that sounds like a wonderful plan."}
