I thought I'd get better, but I feel worse than before. And I'm really worried because I'm scheduled to give a presentation at work on Friday, so I have to be better by then.\nCarla: Well, what seems to be the problem?\nSteve: Well, I thought I had the flu, but the doctor said it was just a bad cold. He gave me some cold medicine to take care of my stuffy nose and fever. I'm supposed to take the medicine three times a day after eating, but it doesn't seem to help. He also told me to stay off my feet for a day or so, but I'm so busy these days.\nCarla: Listen, forget about that medicine! I have just the thing to get rid of bad colds. You see, my mom is really into herbal medicine.\nSteve: Oh, no thanks.\nCarla: Ah, come on! Give it a try. You just take some of my mom's herbal tea and drink it four times a day. Believe me. You'll be up and dancing around in no time.\nSteve: Dancing around in no time, right? Well, I guess. Nothing else seems to be doing the job.\nCarla: Great. I'll come by your place at 7:30. See you then."}
